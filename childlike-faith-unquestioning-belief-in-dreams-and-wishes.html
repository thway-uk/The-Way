<h1>Childlike Faith:  Unquestioning Belief in Dreams and Wishes</h1>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>Verily I say to you, Except you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. </em>— <em>Matthew 18:3 (KJV)</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the call to become <em>"as little children"</em> is not a metaphor for naïvety, but a principle for effective manifestation. It signifies a <strong>mental state of trust, purity, and unshakeable belief</strong> in the power of your imagination—<em>the very essence of <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a></em>. Adults, conditioned by past experiences and societal norms, often lose the child’s open, unquestioning faith. Neville insisted that to create intentionally, one must restore that <strong>childlike state of mind</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What Does It Mean to Become Like Little Children?</h3>
<p>Neville explained that children possess an <strong>unquestioning belief</strong> in the possibility of their dreams. They do not second‑guess themselves or ask if something is "possible"—they simply know it is. This is the foundational law of his system:<br />
<strong>What you imagine and assume to be true, becomes your reality.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>The Child’s Unquestioning Belief</h3>
<p>Children do not doubt. When a child imagines something, they live fully in that vision without worrying about <em>how</em> it will manifest. Neville taught:<br />
<em>"Can you believe in the unseen as strongly as you believe in the visible?"</em><br />
To manifest, you must <strong>feel</strong> your desire as though already fulfilled, with the same certainty and excitement of a child at play.</p>
<hr />
<h3>No Doubt—Only Faith</h3>
<p>Neville declared doubt as the greatest hindrance to manifestation. Children, unburdened by uncertainty, embody the pure faith required:<br />
<em>“You must doubt your doubts and assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</em><br />
This is <strong>childlike faith</strong> in action.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Purity of Assumption</h3>
<p>A child assumes their desire is already fulfilled—whether it’s receiving a gift or conquering make‑believe adventures—<em>without asking “how”</em>. Neville urged a return to that <strong>pure, undiluted assumption</strong> free from past limitations or external conditioning.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Creative Power of Imagination</h3>
<p>For Neville, <strong>imagination is God</strong>. A child’s imagination, untethered by doubt, illustrates divine creativity at its fullest. When you imagine, you align with the power that created the universe. Embrace that divine capacity with <strong>unreserved faith</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Cherubim: Symbolic of Childlike Faith</h3>
<p>Cherubim—angelic guardians of Eden and the Ark—symbolise this very state of <strong>innocent, untainted faith</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Guardians of Creative Power</strong>  
Placed to guard Eden’s entrance (Genesis 3:24) and the mercy‑seat (Exodus 25:20 BBE), cherubim protect the <em>unseen</em> promise—like a child trusts a parent’s protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Divine Alignment</strong>  
Their proximity to God models the <strong>pure connection</strong> between imagination and divine consciousness. Neville taught that embracing childlike trust aligns you fully with this creative source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection of Innocence</strong>  
As cherubim shield the holy, so must you guard your imagination from doubt and negativity, preserving its <strong>untainted power</strong> to manifest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Additional Biblical Symbolism of Childlike Qualities</h3>
<p>These passages further reinforce Neville’s emphasis on <strong>pure, receptive faith</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalm 131:2 (BBE)</strong>  
<em>“But I have quieted and kept myself as a little child that is with his mother: my soul is in me as a weaned child.”</em><br />
A <em>weaned child</em> rests trustingly, no longer crying for every need—mirroring the calm of one who <em>assumes the wish fulfilled</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark 10:14–15 (BBE)</strong>  
<em>“Let the young children come to me...for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it.”</em><br />
Jesus highlights that <strong>reception of the kingdom</strong> demands open‑hearted trust, without reasoning or barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 Peter 2:2 (BBE)</strong>  
<em>“As new born children, long for the pure milk of the word, that by it ye may grow into salvation.”</em><br />
A newborn instinctively craves its mother’s milk—no bargaining or doubt—symbolising the <strong>innate hunger</strong> for the living word (your promised desire).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exodus 25:20 (BBE)</strong>  
<em>“The Cherubim shall stretch forth their wings over the mercy‑seat...towards it shall the faces of the Cherubim be.”</em><br />
Their wings <em>cover</em> the promise, representing <strong>protective innocence</strong> and unwavering faith in the unseen agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 1:3 (BBE)</strong>  
<em>“The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel hath not known me...”</em><br />
Even beasts instinctively trust their provider—highlighting the <strong>natural childlike trust</strong> we are called to emulate.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Cultivate Childlike Faith</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Let Go of Doubts:</strong> Doubt your doubts; replace negativity with the certainty of fulfilled desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume the Feeling of the Wish Fulfilled:</strong> Feel the joy, excitement, and peace as though your desire is real now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Purity of Imagination:</strong> Drop preconceived limits; imagine freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stop Overthinking:</strong> The <em>how</em> is not your concern—focus on the end result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Play and Imagine:</strong> Approach manifestation with the wonder and joy of child’s play.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: Return to the Child Within</h3>
<p>Becoming <em>as little children</em> means reclaiming the <strong>pure, unencumbered belief</strong> in your own divine imagination. It is through this <strong>childlike faith</strong>—mirrored in cherubim, weaned children, and Christ’s own teaching—that you unlock the kingdom of heaven within and manifest the life you truly desire.</p>
