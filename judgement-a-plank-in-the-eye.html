<h1>Judgement: A Plank in the Eye</h1>
<p>In Luke 6:37–42, Jesus says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Rather than a moral code, this is a statement of <strong>spiritual law</strong>. Neville Goddard taught that the <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html"><b>world mirrors our assumptions</b></a>—not our words or outer actions. Judgment, then, is not just criticism of others, but <strong>holding assumptions that deny your <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">desire already fulfilled</a></strong>.</p><p>This brings us back to <strong>Genesis 1:11</strong>, where God commands:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself…”</p>
</blockquote><p>Everything begins with <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">a seed—an <strong>inner idea or assumption</strong></a>. This seed brings forth after its kind. From this principle grow <strong>two symbolic trees</strong> in Eden:<br />
the <strong>Tree of Life</strong>, and the <strong>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong>.</p><p>These represent two ways of using imagination:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Tree of Life</strong> is the assumption that your desire is already fulfilled. It brings life, peace, and alignment with your true self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong> is the habit of judging based on appearances—of assuming lack, separation, or failure. It brings inner division and conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>When Jesus says to forgive and not judge, he is telling you to choose the Tree of Life—<strong>to assume the best</strong>, to let go of what the outer world shows, and to live from the end. You don’t need to fix others. The "plank (wood, tree) in your eye" is your own assumption of separation. Remove that, and the world changes.</p>
