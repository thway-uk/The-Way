    <h1>Why the Bible Is Written to You: An Objective, Text‑Based Argument</h1>
    <p>When reading the Bible, many naturally assume it’s a historical account of an external God communicating to others. Yet, an objective examination of the Bible’s text reveals compelling reasons to see it as written directly to your own <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">conscious awareness</a>.</p><p>Below is a clear explanation based solely on the Bible itself, alongside contrasting examples to help understand this perspective.</p><h3>1. The Bible’s Use of the Second Person: Addressing “You”</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Deuteronomy 6:5</em>: “You shall <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">love</a> the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> your <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Isaiah 41:10</em>: “Fear not, for I am with you...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Revelation 3:20</em>: “Behold, I stand at the <a href="/2025/05/the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">door</a> and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These passages speak directly to you as the reader or listener. The consistent use of “you” invites personal engagement, indicating the Bible’s message is addressed inwardly.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If the Bible were simply historical narration or a report about others, it would employ third-person language:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“They shall love the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> their <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“He said to the people, ‘Do not fear.’”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Such third-person references are mainly found in storytelling sections, not in the core commands or promises, which focus on direct personal instruction.</p><hr /><h3>2. The “I AM” Declaration: A Statement of Consciousness and a Paradox</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Exodus 3:14</em>: <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM THAT I AM.”</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>John 8:58</em>: <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> says, “Before Abraham was, I am.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is a first-person statement pointing to an eternal, self-existent presence—best understood as the awareness present in the moment.</p><p><strong>The paradox explained:</strong></p><p><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM THAT I AM”</a> is not just a simple declaration—it is a profound paradox that transcends ordinary language. It is self-referential, affirming pure existence without defining what that “I” is beyond being itself. It’s a present-tense, eternal statement that defies time-bound identity. This paradox points to a truth beyond words, inviting the reader into direct experience of their own eternal conscious awareness.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If this were a third-person description of an external god, it would likely read:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“He is the eternal one.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“God, who exists before all things.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Instead, the Bible’s use of the first-person present tense suggests that the “I AM” is the very awareness within you, experienced personally and timelessly.</p><hr /><h3>3. The Divine Image: “Let Us Make Man in Our Image”</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Genesis 1:26</em>: “Let us <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">make man</a> in our image, after our likeness.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This implies the divine presence is reflected within you, not merely outside you.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If the divine were wholly external and separate from human consciousness, this passage would not emphasise likeness or image. It would describe humans as mere creations distinct from the divine essence.</p><hr /><h3>4. The Laws and Commands Address Personal Behaviour</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Exodus 20:13</em>: “You shall not murder.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Leviticus 19:3</em>: “You shall keep my Sabbaths.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These commands are directly addressed to you, implying a personal, immediate responsibility.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If the Bible merely chronicled rules given to a distant group, the tone would be more historical and indirect:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“The people were told not to murder.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“They observed the Sabbaths.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Instead, the Bible teaches you directly.</p><hr /><h3>5. The Bible’s Invitations Are Personal and Immediate</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Matthew 11:28</em>: “Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>John 15:7</em>: “If you abide in me, and my words abide in you...”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These intimate calls are directed at your own conscious engagement.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If these were external commands to others, the language would be less personal and more descriptive:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“Jesus invited the crowd to come.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The followers were told to abide.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Instead, the use of “you” makes the invitation immediate and personal.</p><hr /><h3>6. The Bible’s Literal Difficulty Suggests Symbolic Meaning</h3><p><strong>Text evidence:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>The creation story’s contradictions with science and history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paradoxical “I AM THAT I AM” statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prophetic and metaphorical language throughout.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>If taken literally as a historical account of an external god, many passages become confusing or contradictory.</p><p><strong>Contrast:</strong></p><p>If the Bible were strictly literal history or law code, it would avoid paradoxes and symbolic language, focusing instead on straightforward descriptions of external events.</p><p>The symbolic style supports an inner, conscious interpretation directed at you.</p><hr /><h3>7. The Bible’s Core Theme: Looking Past Outer Appearances</h3><p>Someone cannot consciously read and enjoy the Bible literally without confusion or fear because the literal reading often feels contradictory or harsh. The Bible itself encourages looking beyond outer appearances to discover a deeper, life-giving symbolism.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>This symbolic, coded narrative empowers the reader, fostering conscious awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The literal reading often produces shame or suffering, while the symbolic reading invites life and transformation.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Bible as a Dialogue with Your Conscious Awareness</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>The Bible consistently speaks in the second person, addressing you directly rather than describing others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “I AM” paradox points to your own eternal awareness, the core of your being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are made in the divine image, linking you intimately to this presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laws, promises, and invitations come as personal calls to transformation and awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The symbolic and sometimes paradoxical nature of the text reveals its true purpose—to guide you beyond surface appearances into conscious engagement with the divine within.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Objectively and factually from the text alone, the Bible is primarily written as a message to your own conscious awareness, inviting you to awaken and connect with the eternal presence within yourself.</strong></p>
