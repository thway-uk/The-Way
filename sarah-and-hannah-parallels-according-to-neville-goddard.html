    <h1>Sarah and Hannah Parallels According to Neville Goddard</h1>
    <p>In the Bible, the story of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, is a profound illustration of the power of imagination and how faith, assumption, and feeling can <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">bring desires into physical reality</a>. This story aligns perfectly with Neville Goddard’s teaching that imagination is the creative force behind manifestation.</p><h3>Genesis 2:23 and the Calling of Woman as the Subconscious Womb</h3><p>To deepen our understanding, we begin with <strong>Genesis 2:23</strong>, where Adam declares:</p><blockquote>
<p>“This is now bone of my bones<br />
and flesh of my flesh;<br />
she shall be called Woman,<br />
because she was taken out of Man.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The phrase “<a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">she shall be called Woman</a>” here is more than a simple naming; it is a <strong>calling forth</strong>—a declaration of her essential function and destiny within consciousness. Woman is <em>called</em> to be the receptive power, the creative womb within the mind that gives form to the desires <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">conceived by Man</a>. She emerges not just as a label but as a vital, active force of creation.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, this Woman symbolises the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, the inner receptive faculty within us. Conscious awareness <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">(Man)</a> conceives desire, and Woman—the subconscious—receives, nurtures, and manifests it into physical reality. Without this receptive subconscious, the imagined desire remains unformed and unmanifested.</p><hr /><h3>Hannah and Sarah: Parallels as Aspects of the Subconscious Woman</h3><p>The biblical figures <strong>Hannah</strong> and <strong>Sarah</strong> personify this subconscious Woman in complementary states:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong> begins as barren, symbolising the creative void—the silent subconscious before it is impressed with desire. Her deep yearning for a child represents the stirring of imagination within this receptive subconscious. When Hannah prays with feeling and faith, she assumes the feeling of her wish fulfilled, impressing the subconscious mind. This act of assumption is the key to her eventual manifestation of Samuel, the “asked of God.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong> represents the challenge of doubt within the subconscious. Though barren for years, she initially laughs at God’s promise, embodying disbelief or resistance within this inner receptive aspect. However, when Sarah ultimately embraces faith and aligns her thoughts with the promise, she conceives Isaac despite all odds.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, Hannah and Sarah illustrate the dynamic journey of the subconscious Woman—from yearning and hopeful faith to overcoming doubt and fully receiving the promise. They reveal the dance between conscious faith and subconscious reception necessary for manifestation.</p><hr /><h3>Hannah’s Yearning: Desire and Imagination</h3><p>Hannah’s story begins with her deep yearning for a child, a desire that mirrors the conscious mind’s act of conceiving a vision. Her barrenness is not a permanent lack but the creative silence preceding manifestation. In <strong>1 Samuel 1:10-11</strong>, Hannah’s heartfelt prayer reflects Neville’s principle of “living in the end” — she assumes the feeling of the wish fulfilled:</p><blockquote>
<p>“O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant… but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This prayer is more than a request—it is an act of faith and assumption, impressing the subconscious with the reality of her desire already fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3>Sarah’s Doubt and the Power of Faith</h3><p>Sarah’s story, recorded in <strong>Genesis 18:10-14</strong>, mirrors Hannah’s but adds the element of doubt. When God promises Abraham that Sarah will bear a son, she laughs in disbelief, representing the subconscious resistance born of limiting beliefs or past conditioning.</p><p>Yet God reassures Abraham:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Is anything too hard for the Lord?”</p>
</blockquote><p>This question embodies Neville’s teaching that <strong>nothing is impossible</strong> when imagination and faith are rightly aligned. When Sarah finally embraces this promise, the subconscious Woman shifts from doubt to faith, and the impossible is made manifest through Isaac’s birth.</p><hr /><h3>The Power of Faith and Feeling</h3><p>Both Hannah and Sarah’s stories emphasise the role of faith and feeling in aligning conscious desire with the subconscious receptive faculty. Hannah’s prayer and Sarah’s eventual belief impress the subconscious Woman with the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Neville Goddard teaches that feeling is the secret to manifestation—the subconscious acts upon the impressions it receives.</p><hr /><h3>Manifestation: The Birth of Samuel and Isaac</h3><p>Hannah’s faith results in the birth of Samuel, whose name means “asked of God.” Isaac’s birth to Sarah follows a similar pattern—both children are the physical manifestation of desires deeply impressed upon the subconscious mind and birthed through the union of conscious assumption and subconscious reception.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Inner Woman as the Womb of Creation</h3><p>Hannah and Sarah are not just historical figures but symbolic aspects of the Woman born from Man in Genesis 2:23—the subconscious creative faculty within us all. Their stories illustrate Neville Goddard’s essential teaching: conscious desire must impress the subconscious with the feeling of the wish fulfilled for manifestation to occur.</p><p>By understanding Hannah and Sarah as the subconscious Woman, we see that faith, imagination, and feeling work together within our minds to birth our desires into reality. Like them, we too can awaken the inner Woman, speak our desires into existence, and trust the creative power of imagination to make the impossible possible.</p>
