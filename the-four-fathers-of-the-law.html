Every key represents a <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">quality of mind</a> necessary for bringing the unseen into form.  </p><p><strong><a href="/search/label/Abraham%20Series">Abraham</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/search/label/Jacob%20Series">Jacob</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">Joseph</a> </strong>, and <strong><a href="/search/label/Judah%20Series">Judah</a> </strong>—are the founding fathers of the Law of Assumption, illustrating how to use cultivate the self and imagination to bring the unseen into reality. Each figure demonstrates a key aspect of imagining and embodying your desired state. They reveal the process of manifestation through qualities of <b>Faith, Persistence in Change, Imagination, and Praise.</b> Symbolically aligned with the <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">four Gospels,</a> these figures teach the practical and spiritual steps necessary to assume, sustain, and realise your vision.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="/search/label/Abraham%20Series">ABRAHAM: FAITH</a> (Matthew)</h2><p><a href="/2025/04/the-smoking-firepot-and-blazing-torch.html">Abraham</a> is the father of faith—an inner conviction in the unseen promise. He sets out on a journey based purely on trust in <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God's</a> word, forsaking his past and the known world. This mirrors the <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a> of Matthew, which opens with the realisation of divine promise through the genealogy of Jesus, tracing it back to David and then to Abraham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The book of the <a href="/2025/05/the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">genealogy of Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of Abraham.”</em><br />
— Matthew 1:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abraham’s departure from his homeland is a shift in awareness. It is mirrored beautifully in Matthew’s own act of leaving his tax booth when called by Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And he said to him, ‘Follow me.’ And he rose and followed him.”</em><br />
— Matthew 9:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as <a href="/2025/04/the-smoking-firepot-and-blazing-torch.html">Abraham</a> abandoned the old life to walk in faith, Matthew leaves the symbols of worldly gain behind. Both are acts of inward trust in a higher calling.</p><p>Abraham’s willingness to <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-of-abraham-and-isaac.html">sacrifice Isaac</a> is not about killing faith—it’s about releasing attachment to the external world. Just as he was required to <a href="/2025/07/abraham-surrender-of-attachments.html">cast out Hagar</a> and Ishmael, breaking with the mindset that tries to force outcomes, he is now asked to <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-of-abraham-and-isaac.html">surrender Isaac</a>—who represents the outer appearance we are usually so quick to cling to. The story teaches that we must never idolise the visible form, but instead trust the unseen creative power—imagination itself—as the true source of life..</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong><br />
Faith, for Neville, is not blind belief but the assumption that what you desire is already true. It is the ability to feel and live from the end—just as Abraham did. This is the first step in the creative process: a shift in identity rooted in the unseen but held with conviction.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="/search/label/Jacob%20Series">JACOB: PERSISTANCE</a> (Mark)</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><p><a href="/search/label/Jacob%20Series">Jacob’s journey</a> is one of inner struggle and relentless persistence. He wrestles his way through life—first with <a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">Esau</a>, then with <a href="/2025/05/leaving-old-state-behind-genesis-224.html">Laban</a>, and ultimately with the <a href="/2025/05/jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">vision of his transformed self </a>in the encounter with the angel (or man, depending on the translation). This defining moment culminates in his words:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>“I will not let you go unless you bless me.”<br />
— Genesis 32:26</blockquote><p></p>
<p><a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">Jacob’s supplanting of Esau’s identity</a> earlier in the narrative is a living demonstration of this spiritual principle: transformation comes not through force or violence, but by <strong>assuming and embodying the new state of being</strong>. His persistence reflects the active process of <a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">claiming a new identity</a> until it is fully secured — a theme echoed in the immediacy and urgency found in Mark’s Gospel, the most movement-driven of the four.</p></div><blockquote>
<p>“And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.”<br />
— Mark 1:12</p>
</blockquote><p>Jacob personifies spiritual tenacity—the unwavering refusal to surrender until the imagined state is made real.</p><p>






</p><p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong><br />
Persistence is the determination to see only the end imagined. Regardless of appearances, you hold fast to the assumption that your desire is already fulfilled. Jacob’s refusal to release his grip is the psychological blueprint of this truth—a living image of the Law in action.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">JOSEPH: IMAGINATION</a> (Luke)</h2>
<p><a href="/2025/04/joseph-dreamers-ascent-awakening-power.html">Joseph</a> is the dreaming imagination. Not only does he dream, but he <a href="/2025/04/joseph-dreamer-when-imagination-is.html">interprets dreams</a>—and lives by their unfolding. Sold into <a href="/2025/04/joseph-dreamers-ascent-awakening-power.html">slavery, thrown into prison, then rising to power through the clarity of vision</a>, Joseph represents the power of imagination to reshape reality.</p>
<p>Luke’s <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a> echoes this through its poetic and visionary storytelling. From angelic visitations to the prophetic Magnificat, Luke is a Gospel of divine possibilities born from within:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.”</em><br />
— Luke 1:30</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagination births divine life in Luke, just as <a href="/2025/04/joseph-dreamers-ascent-awakening-power.html">Joseph’s</a> dreams birthed redemption for his family and Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong><br />
Imagination is the creative power of God within man. <a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">Joseph</a> lives from his inner vision, and his life bends to match it. According to Neville, what you imagine with feeling becomes your world. Joseph teaches us that the images we faithfully hold will shape our fate.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Bible Verses for Imagination and Luke:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 1:37 — “For with God nothing will be impossible.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 1:45 — “Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">Joseph’s</a> dreams and the visions described in Luke’s <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a> both represent the ability to shape one’s future through divine imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="/search/label/Judah%20Series">JUDAH</a> | <a href="/2025/04/judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">JUDAS</a>: PRAISE (John)</h2>
<p><a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah’s</a> name means <em>praise</em>—a conscious expression of <b><i>raised</i></b> <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> identity. He becomes a turning point in the narrative, both by stepping forward to protect Benjamin and by becoming the ancestor of the Christ line. In Neville’s symbolism, <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah</a> is the quality of recognition—recognising the difference between the new self and the old self, and the power of imagination itself.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a> of John centres entirely on divine,<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"> I AM'ness</a>. Jesus makes seven “I AM” declarations, each a profound affirmation of oneness with God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”</em><br />
— John 14:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong><br /><a href="/search/label/Praise%20Series">Praise</a>, in Neville’s terms, is not flattery of a distant God, but the bold inner realisation: <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"><em>I AM He</em>. </a><a href="/search/label/Judah%20Series">Judah</a> is not just <a href="/search/label/Praise%20Series">praise</a> with words—it is the inner act of assuming a <i><b>raised</b></i> identity. Manifestation happens through this assumption.</p>
<p><strong>The Symbolism of John’s Beheading and Judas’s Betrayal:</strong><br />
Neville speaks symbolically of John the Baptist's beheading as the necessary death of the forerunner—the voice of preparation must decrease, so the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> can rise. In self- perception, this is the transition from preparing to be something, to <em>being</em> it. It is a severance from doubt, hesitation, or duality.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="/2025/04/judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">Judas’s</a> betrayal is not moral failure but psychological necessity. <a href="/2025/04/judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">Judas</a>, who knew Jesus most intimately, must <em>"betray"</em> him—just as our rational mind must surrender the known to allow manifestation. Judas hands over the I AM to be <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucified</a>, which in Neville’s work is always the act of <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">fixing an idea in imagination</a>—so that it can rise again as fact.</p>
<p>John's <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Gospel</a>, with its focus on praise, carries these intense moments to show us the price of embodying the divine: the death of lesser selves, the betrayal of old ideas, the surrender of control. Praise becomes not just joyful affirmation, but fierce knowing.</p>

<h3>Male Figures as States of Being</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, male characters in the Bible personify states of conscious awareness. They represent shifts in awareness—moments when a person takes hold of a new understanding and begins to shape life from it. These figures aren’t passive symbols; they act as agents of change, showing how a clearer, more intentional mindset guides the unfolding of experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham</strong> represents the birth of faith—a fundamental shift in awareness toward trusting the unseen and moving away from limiting beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong> embodies persistence in assuming new identity, awakening to the need for tenacity and determination in manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joseph</strong>, the dreamer, symbolises the creative faculty of imagination that shapes and directs reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah</strong> represents praise—the conscious recognition and embodiment of the divine identity: <em>I AM</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each figure serves as an archetype for mental faculties that manifest the divine in the material world. They are not historical, but symbolic of consciousness in motion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>✦ Conclusion: The Gospels as Stages of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Each Gospel represents a progressive movement of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew (Abraham):</strong> Faith—leaving behind the seen to trust the unseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark (Jacob):</strong> Persistence—struggling and striving until the blessing comes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke (Joseph):</strong> Imagination—dreaming and holding a vision until it reshapes life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John (Judah and Judas):</strong> Praise—embodying and expressing divine identity: <em>I AM</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not just stories. They are stages of your own inner journey. Neville Goddard taught that scripture was written about <em>you</em>—the individual—and these four stages are the arc of your awakening.</p>
<p>By living like <a href="/2025/07/why-there-are-four-gospels-witnesses.html">Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah</a>—not as distant patriarchs, but as <strong>states of mind</strong>—you walk the path from <strong>promise to fulfilment</strong>, from <strong>dream to incarnation</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are the Gospel. You are the Word made flesh.</strong></p></blockquote>
