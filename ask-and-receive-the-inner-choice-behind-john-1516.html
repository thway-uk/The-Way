<h1>Ask and Receive: The Inner Choice Behind John 15:16</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>"You did not take me for yourselves, but I took you for myself, and I gave you orders to go and get fruit, the fruit of which will be for ever: so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you."</em><br />
— <strong>John 15:16, BBE</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote>"<b><i>I am</i></b> my beloved’s and my beloved is <b><i>mine</i></b>;" - Song of Solomon 6:3</blockquote><p></p><p> This verse, seen through Neville Goddard’s insight, is not about an external deity choosing you—but the awakening of your own awareness to imagination as the true creative power.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Chosen by the I AM Within</strong></h2><p>“You did not take me for yourselves” reflects the idea that spiritual awakening isn’t decided by intellect. The shift happens when your deeper self—the I AM—calls you to <em>see</em>.</p><p>The “me” here is not a man, but the <em>awareness of being</em>. The moment you awaken to this truth, you’re no longer a passive believer—you become a conscious creator.</p><hr /><h2><strong>You Were Appointed to Bear Fruit</strong></h2><p>To be given orders “to go and get fruit” is to be appointed to live from this awakened state. Neville taught that fruit symbolises <em>manifestation</em>—the outer result of your inner assumption.</p><p>And not just any fruit—<strong>fruit that lasts</strong>. When you fully accept a state in imagination and persist in it, it stabilises in the outer world.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Ask in My Name</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“So that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To ask “in my name” is not about using sacred words. According to Neville, it’s about <em>entering into the state of the wish fulfilled</em>. The “Father” is your subconscious, and “my name” refers to the consciousness of <strong>I AM</strong>.</p><p>This ties directly to <strong>Exodus 3:14</strong> (BBE):</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"And God said to Moses, I AM WHAT I AM: and he said, Say this to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The name of God is not a title—it is a state of being. You ask by becoming. You don’t ask <em>for</em> something; you assume the state of having already received it.</p><p>Neville wrote:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“To pray in His name is to assume the nature of the thing desired. It is to claim ‘I AM’ that which I desire to be.”</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Believe You Have Received</strong></h2><p>This is made even clearer in <strong>Mark 11:24 (BBE):</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>"For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Prayer, in this context, is not begging. It’s <strong>embodying</strong>. You accept the wish as fulfilled and persist in that state. That’s the real asking. That’s how you receive.</p><p></p><blockquote>"<b><i>I am</i></b> my beloved’s and my beloved is <b><i>mine</i></b>" - Song of Solomon 6:3</blockquote><p></p><hr /><h2><strong>The True Meaning of Asking</strong></h2><p>Together, these verses point to an inner pattern:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You are <em>chosen</em> when you awaken to the power of imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are <em>appointed</em> to live from this awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <em>bear fruit</em> by persisting in assumed states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <em>ask in His name</em> by entering the I AM state—already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ask, and you shall receive—because in imagination, you already have.</strong></p>
