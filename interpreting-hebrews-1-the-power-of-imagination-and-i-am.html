<h1>Interpreting Hebrews 1: The Power of Imagination and I AM</h1>
<p>In <strong>Hebrews 1</strong>, we uncover the relationship between <strong>God</strong> and <strong>Jesus</strong>, which, according to Neville Goddard, can be understood as <strong>I AM</strong> (pure consciousness) and <strong>imagination</strong> (the outward expression of that consciousness). This passage reveals the profound connection between consciousness and creation. Let’s explore the key verses and understand them through Neville's teachings.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:1-2</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Here, <strong>God</strong> (I AM) is the source of all creation. While <strong>God</strong> communicated through prophets in the past, now the full revelation is clear: it is through <strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination) that all things are created. <strong>Jesus</strong> (manifestation) is the active force of creation, and through <strong>imagination</strong>, <strong>I AM</strong> brings forth the universe—our reality. The <strong>Son</strong> (Jesus) is the heir of all things because manifestation is the result of <strong>I AM</strong>, and everything emanates from the creative power of imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:3</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
<strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination) is the <strong>radiance</strong> of <strong>God</strong> (I AM)—the outward expression of inner consciousness. Just as light radiates from the sun, <strong>Jesus</strong> is the manifestation of <strong>I AM</strong>. The <strong>Son</strong> sustains all things by the <strong>word</strong>—our thoughts, words, and beliefs shape our reality. Our imagination is the active force that sustains and forms our world.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:4-5</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. For to which of the angels did God ever say, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father’?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
<strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination) is superior to the <strong>angels</strong>, which Neville might interpret as reactive mental states or faculties. <strong>Imagination</strong> is the dominant creative force, surpassing other mental faculties (the <strong>angels</strong>). The phrase “<strong>You are my Son; today I have become your Father</strong>” symbolises the unity between <strong>God</strong> (I AM) and <strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination). <strong>God</strong> and <strong>Jesus</strong> are one—what you imagine, you create.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:8-9</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.’"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
<strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination) is seated on the throne, which Neville might interpret as the <strong>mind</strong>—the seat of creation. The <strong>scepter of justice</strong> represents aligning the mind with truth and righteousness. Through this alignment, <strong>Jesus</strong> (manifestation) has dominion over reality. The <strong>oil of joy</strong> symbolises the abundant and joyful results of using imagination correctly. When you align your imagination with truth, your manifestations are full of peace, abundance, and joy.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:10-12</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
This passage reflects the eternal, unchanging nature of <strong>God</strong> (I AM). While manifestations (the <strong>Son</strong>) are temporary and subject to change, <strong>God</strong> (I AM) remains constant. Our circumstances (manifestations) are fleeting, like a garment, but the creative power of <strong>God</strong> (I AM) remains ever-present, unchanging, and eternal.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrews 1:13-14</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"To which of the angels did God ever say, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet’? Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
The <strong>right hand</strong> symbolises authority and power. Sitting at the <strong>right hand</strong> means having dominion over all creation. <strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination) is seated on the throne of the <strong>mind</strong>, with full control over reality. The <strong>angels</strong> (other mental faculties) are tools that serve those who understand the power of <strong>imagination</strong>. Our mental faculties support the creative force of imagination, which rules over our world.</p>
<p>The <strong>enemies</strong> made a footstool represent the obstacles and challenges beneath the power of imagination. Through <strong>God</strong> (I AM), all things are subject to our creative authority.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, <strong>Hebrews 1</strong> reveals the relationship between <strong>God</strong> (I AM) and <strong>Jesus</strong> (imagination). <strong>God</strong> is the source of all creative power—consciousness—while <strong>Jesus</strong> is the active, outward expression of that power, manifested through imagination. The passage emphasises that imagination is the ruling force of creation, sustaining all things, and that everything we experience is a result of our inner consciousness (<strong>God</strong>) expressed through our imagination (<strong>Jesus</strong>).</p>
<p>By understanding <strong>God</strong> (I AM) and <strong>Jesus</strong> (manifestation) as one, we recognise our creative power and our ability to shape our reality through imagination. This is the essence of Neville’s teachings: we are the creators of our own experience, and through imagination, we bring our desires into being.</p>
