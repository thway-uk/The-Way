<h1>Speaking in Tongues: Inner Dialogue and Speech</h1>
<p>In the opening chapters of Genesis, the name <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html"><strong>Elohim</strong> introduces God</a> not simply as a singular being, but as a plural term signifying “gods,” “judges,” “rulers,” and “mighty powers.” Despite this plurality, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Elohim—God</a>—acts as one unified creative force. Neville Goddard’s teachings reveal that Elohim symbolises the manifold faculties within the human imagination—the many “voices,” assumptions, and states of consciousness that collectively shape reality. This is why God is sometimes called the <strong>Lord of Hosts</strong>.</p><p>This understanding connects deeply with the biblical concept of <strong>“tongues”</strong>, often misunderstood as literal foreign languages, but in truth representing the inner speech and assumptions flowing from the imaginative mind. Neville taught that our world is a mirror of the silent conversations we hold with ourselves—the “tongues” of our imagination.</p><hr /><h3>Elohim: The Many Within the One</h3><p>The plural form <strong>Elohim</strong> reflects the diversity within your <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>—the judges and rulers inside that evaluate, assume, and ultimately create your experience. Every inner assumption acts like a decree; whatever you accept as true becomes the lens through which reality unfolds.</p><p>Genesis 1:26 says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...”</p>
</blockquote><p>This “us” indicates the plurality of imaginative faculties working together, crafting the self-concept known as “man.” <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">Creation</a> begins in imagination—the inner heaven—and manifests as the outer earth, following the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>: feeling a thing to be true until it hardens into fact.</p><p>Each command by <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Elohim</a> in Genesis 1—</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Let the dry land appear” (Genesis 1:9) —</p>
</li>
</ul><p>represents an <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">inner decree shaping the outer world.</a></p><hr /><h3>The Tower of Babel: The Insertion of the Law of Assumption</h3><p>The <a href="/2025/05/divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">Tower of Babel</a> (Genesis 11:1–9) follows the story of Noah, which symbolises a great cleansing and refreshing of the human mind—wiping away old, limiting assumptions and mental clutter.</p><p>After this reset, the <b>children of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a></b> (consciousness) still builds reality the old way, through <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">toil, external effort</a>, and unified but unconscious assumptions:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now the whole earth had one language and one speech... And the LORD said, ‘Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language... Come, let us go down and confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.’”</em> (Genesis 11:1, 6–7)</p>
</blockquote><p>At Babel, this <strong>one language</strong> symbolises a unified but <b><i>externally</i></b> focused imagination striving to reach an external heaven by building a tower—a metaphor for human ambition using old mental effort. The <strong>confusion of tongues</strong> is not merely a punishment but the <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">insertion of the Law of Assumption</a></strong>—the awakening to a new mode of creation based on inner assumption rather than <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">external toil.</a></p><p>This “confusion” fragments the old way of building, scattering language and, symbolically, the scattered and unconscious assumptions held in belief. It forces a disruption in how reality is created, heralding a new era where <strong>conscious assumption</strong> becomes the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">language of creation.</a></p><hr /><h3>Elohim and Tongues: Inner Judges and the Language of Creation</h3><p>The plural judges and rulers of <strong>Elohim</strong> are the many voices within your imagination, and the “tongues” are the inner conversations these states speak. Your assumptions are your language, your decrees, and your judgments.</p><p>When those assumptions become fragmented—when inner speech becomes confused—manifestation becomes erratic and unstable.</p><p>Conversely, when you <strong>“speak in new tongues”</strong> (Mark 16:17), you adopt <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new assumptions aligned with your desire’s fulfilment.</a> The inner language changes, and so does your outer reality.</p><hr /><h3>Pentecost and the Power of Assumed Belief</h3><p>At Pentecost:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.”</em> (Acts 2:4)</p>
</blockquote><p>The <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> symbolises the awakened imagination. Speaking in tongues here means <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">expressing new creative </a>states, aligned with the feeling of the wish fulfilled. This marks the moment when inner assumptions become vivid and reality starts to reflect them.</p><hr /><h3>Interpretation and Mastery of Inner Speech</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“To another kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.”</em> (1 Corinthians 12:10)</p>
</blockquote><p>There are many kinds of inner speech—different states of consciousness and assumptions. Interpretation means becoming conscious of these assumptions and <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">gaining mastery</a> over your inner dialogue—and thus over your reality.</p><hr /><h3>Building the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Inner Man</a> Through Assumption</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves.”</em> (1 Corinthians 14:4)</p>
</blockquote><p>To deliberately <strong>speak in tongues</strong> is to strengthen your inner world by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Your assumptions shape your external world accordingly.</p><hr /><h3>Cornelius’ Awakening: Baptism into a New State of Being</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God.”</em> (Acts 10:46)</p>
</blockquote><p>This represents full immersion into a new consciousness—baptism into the Law of Assumption—where changed assumptions create new realities, confirmed outwardly by the tongues that follow.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: Speak Your World into Being</h3><p>You are <strong>Elohim</strong>—the creative imagination—speaking in tongues through your inner conversation. To “speak in tongues” is to deliberately change your assumptions, to embody the feeling of your wish fulfilled, and thus to create your desired world.</p><p>Your inner speech is sacred. When aligned, it acts as the many voices of Elohim, ruling and judging your reality into being. This is the true meaning of biblical creation and the power of tongues—the Law of Assumption in action.</p>
