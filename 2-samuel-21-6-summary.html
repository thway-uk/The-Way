<h1>2 Samuel 2:1-6 (Summary)</h1>
<p>David, after Saul’s death, asks the Lord if he should go up to any of the cities of Judah. The Lord says, "Go up." David then asks, "Where?" and is told, "Hebron."</p><p>
There, David is anointed king over the house of Judah. He hears that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had buried Saul, and he sends them a message of kindness and blessing.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Neville’s Symbolic Reading</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>David</strong></h4>
<p>David always represents the <em>ideal you</em>, the divine imagination now consciously expressing itself — the <em>manifestation of spiritual awareness</em>. He is not just “a man after God’s heart,” but a <em>state of being</em> that knows imagination is God in action.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>1. “Shall I go up?”</strong></h4>
<p>David asks if he should go up — this is the moment of <em>inner direction</em>, the turning inward to intuition (the Lord) rather than outward appearances.<br />
In Neville’s terms, it’s asking: <em>“Shall I move into a new state?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Key principle</strong>:<br />
When the old state (Saul, the ego-reliant self) dies, there is a vacuum — you must choose <em>consciously</em> what state to ascend into next.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>2. “Go up… to Hebron.”</strong></h4>
<p>Hebron means “association” or “joining.” Spiritually, it symbolises a <em>binding together</em> of your inner conviction with your outer assumption.</p>
<p>This is the act of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choosing the new state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving into union with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Living from the wish fulfilled</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hebron is the <em>internal agreement</em> that makes manifestation possible.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>3. “David reigned over the house of Judah”</strong></h4>
<p>Judah symbolises <strong>praise</strong> — and praise is the fertile soil of imagination. To reign over Judah means to <strong>rule your inner world with thanksgiving</strong>, not fear.</p>
<p>In other words:<br />
The awakened imagination (David) takes dominion over the emotional state of praise, which is the doorway to all answered prayer.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>4. David blesses the men who buried Saul</strong></h4>
<p>The parting gesture to the old self is kindness. Neville would say: don’t condemn your past. Honour it for what it taught you — and move on.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t kill the old man with judgment,</strong><br />
you bury him with understanding.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>This passage shows the <em>spiritual mechanics</em> of transformation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask inwardly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obey the nudge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Join yourself to your new state (Hebron)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reign over praise (Judah)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless the past and move on</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are David — and when you stop trying to fix Saul and instead <em>move into dominion</em> through imagination, the kingdom begins.</p>
