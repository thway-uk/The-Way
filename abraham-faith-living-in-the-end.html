    <h1>Abraham: Faith Living in the End</h1>
    <p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, one of the most powerful principles is <strong>living in the end</strong>. This means to <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">assume the state of the wish fulfilled</a></strong>—to fully <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">embody the person who already possesses what they desire</a>. A profound example of this principle is found in the story of <strong>Abraham</strong>, <a href="/2025/04/the-divine-breath-understanding-h-in.html">whose <strong>name change</strong></a> from <strong>Abram</strong> to <strong>Abraham</strong> serves as a symbolic moment of <strong>identity transformation</strong> and manifestation.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Power of Identity Transformation: Abraham’s Name Change</strong></h3><p>In <strong>Genesis 17:5</strong>, <a href="/2025/04/the-divine-breath-understanding-h-in.html">God changes <strong>Abram’s</strong> name to <strong>Abraham</strong></a>, saying: <em>“No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations.”</em></p><p>The name <strong>Abram</strong> means “exalted father,” while <strong>Abraham</strong> means “father of many nations.” This change isn’t just a symbolic act; it is a <strong>shift in identity</strong> that aligns with <a href="/2025/07/abraham-promise-and-covenant.html">God’s promise</a>. It is a <strong>declaration</strong> that Abraham is no longer simply an individual with limited potential but is now the father of nations. <strong>Abraham’s name change</strong> represents the <strong>embodiment of the end result</strong>—he is called to live <strong>as though</strong> the promise of fathering many nations has already been fulfilled.</p><p>Neville Goddard often emphasizes that in order to manifest anything, we must first <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>. Abraham’s transformation from Abram to Abraham is a perfect example of this principle. To manifest the <strong>promise of many descendants</strong>, Abraham had to <strong>assume the identity</strong> of the <strong>father of many nations</strong> long before it physically manifested in his life. By embracing this new identity, he was aligning his <strong>imagination with the end result</strong>—just as we must do when manifesting our own desires.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Living in the End: A Shift in Consciousness</strong></h3><p>This principle of <strong>living in the end</strong> means fully embodying the <strong>end result</strong> of your desire, just as Abraham did when he <strong>adopted his new name</strong>. It’s not just about wishing for something to happen but about <strong>becoming</strong> the person who has already received that desire. Abraham had to shift his <strong>consciousness</strong> from being someone who was merely an “exalted father” to someone who is already the <strong>father of many nations</strong>.</p><p>This is the essence of <strong>manifestation</strong>: it is not about striving to attain something; it’s about <strong>aligning your consciousness</strong> with the version of you that already has what you desire. In Neville's terms, it’s about assuming the state of the wish fulfilled in the <strong>imagination</strong> and allowing that assumption to permeate your entire being.</p><h4><strong>God’s Promise: Calling Those Things That Are Not</strong></h4><p>In <strong>Romans 4:17</strong>, the apostle Paul speaks to the same concept when he writes:</p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“As it is written, 'I have made you a father of many nations'—in the presence of Him whom he believed—God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did.”</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Just as God <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-smoking-firepot-and-blazing-torch.html">calls Abraham the father of many nations</a></strong> before it is visible in the natural world, so too can we <strong>call forth the desires of our hearts</strong> before they physically manifest. When Abraham was given the name <strong>Abraham</strong>, it was a <strong>declaration of the end result</strong>. In the same way, we must <strong>call those things which do not exist as though they did</strong>, <strong>living in the end</strong> as though our desires have already been fulfilled.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Importance of Living in the End: Becoming the Manifested Self</strong></h3><p>Abraham’s name change marks a pivotal moment in his journey of manifestation, one that we can all learn from. By <strong>fully embracing a new identity</strong>, Abraham <strong>stepped into</strong> the reality of the promise. He began to <strong>live as though</strong> he already had what was promised to him. He wasn’t waiting for a child to be born to take on the name of the father of many nations—he was <strong>living as though</strong> he already had many nations through his descendants.</p><p>This teaches us a vital lesson about <strong>identity</strong> and <strong>manifestation</strong>. <strong>Living in the end</strong> means fully embodying the <strong>person you desire to be</strong>—even before the physical evidence of that desire shows up. Just as Abraham had to <strong>assume the identity of the father of many nations</strong> to bring forth the promise, we must <strong>assume the identity</strong> of the person who already has what we desire.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion: Abraham’s Story as a Manifestation Pattern</strong></h3><p>Abraham’s journey from Abram to Abraham encapsulates the power of <strong>living in the end</strong>. His name change was not just a new title but a <strong>shift in his self-identity</strong> that aligned him with the <strong>end result</strong>—the fulfillment of God's promise. This transformation mirrors the process of manifestation that Neville Goddard teaches: we must <strong>embody the state of our wish fulfilled</strong>, live as though the desire is already ours, and align our thoughts and actions with that reality.</p><p>Just as Abraham stepped into his <strong>new identity</strong>, we too must step into our <strong>desired reality</strong>. By fully <strong>embracing who we wish to become</strong>, we open the door for that new identity to become our living experience. In the end, <strong>living in the end</strong> is not just a mental exercise—it is a complete <strong>transformation of consciousness</strong>, one that leads to the <strong>manifestation</strong> of our desires in the physical world.</p><p><br /></p>
