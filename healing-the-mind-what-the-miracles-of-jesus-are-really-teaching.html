    <h1>Healing the Mind: What the Miracles of Jesus Are Really Teaching</h1>
    <p>The healing miracles recorded in the Gospels are some of the most famous stories in the Bible. For centuries, they have been read as literal accounts of physical diseases being cured -the blind receiving sight, the lame walking, the deaf hearing, and the lepers cleansed.</p><p>When understood only as physical events, these stories are admired but left in the past. They become spectacles to marvel at rather than instructions for <strong>inner transformation</strong>. The true value of the healing dialogues is lost.</p><hr /><h2>Healing as a Symbol of Consciousness</h2><p>Symbolically, every healing in the life of Jesus is about the <strong>healing of consciousness</strong>.<br />
It is not about physical illness but about correcting the distorted inner states that cause suffering.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blindness</strong> symbolises <strong>ignorance</strong> — the inability or refusal to see imaginatively. To be blind is to live only by the evidence of the senses, unable to perceive the creative power within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lameness</strong> symbolises the failure to move in <strong>faith</strong> — the paralysis caused by doubt, fear, or acceptance of limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leprosy</strong> symbolises a corrupted <strong>self-image</strong> — deep feelings of shame, guilt, or unworthiness that isolate the individual from their true potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deafness</strong> symbolises the inability to hear the <strong>inner voice</strong> — the guidance of imagination, the whispered assumptions that shape experience.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>The True Meaning of Jesus’ Healing</h2><p>When Jesus heals, He is not simply repairing a broken body. He is <strong>restoring the individual's awareness of their creative identity</strong>.<br />
He shows that salvation is the healing of the mind — a correction of belief, a cleansing of perception, and a return to inner vision.</p><p>Throughout the Gospels, <strong>Jesus symbolises the imagination</strong> — the creative power that can remake the inner world.<br />
Through imagination, we walk the landscape of our own minds, touching and healing the negative states that have paralysed us, blinded us, deafened us, and made us feel unworthy.<br />
Each healing is a living reminder that it is imagination, rightly used, that sets us free.</p><hr /><h2>Examples of Symbolic Healing</h2><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>healing of the blind man</strong> is the restoration of <strong>spiritual sight</strong> — the ability to see beyond appearances and imagine the unseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof</strong> symbolises breaking through old mental barriers to claim a new state of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>cleansing of the lepers</strong> represents the purification of the subconscious mind from self-rejection and shame.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>From Distant Stories to Personal Transformation</h2><p>When we read the healings symbolically, they are no longer distant stories.<br />
They become <strong>personal blueprints</strong> for our own transformation.<br />
They show us how to reclaim the creative power of imagination and heal the inner divisions that prevent us from living fully.</p><p>The <strong>literal reading</strong> wastes the message, leaving it trapped in history.<br />
The <strong>symbolic reading</strong> brings the message to life — here, now, within you.</p>
