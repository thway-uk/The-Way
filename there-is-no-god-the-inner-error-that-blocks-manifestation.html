<h1>There Is No God? The Inner Error That Blocks Manifestation</h1>
<p> Psalm 53:1–3 (KJV) reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong> The fool hath said in his heart, <em>There is no God.</em> Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.<br />
<strong>2</strong> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.<br />
<strong>3</strong> Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Interpreted through Neville Goddard’s teachings:</h3>
<p><strong>1. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”</strong><br />
Neville would say the “fool” is not someone without intellect, but someone who denies the <em>power of imagination</em>, which he equates with God. When one says “there is no God,” they’re effectively saying “there is no creative power within me.” The heart, in Neville’s teachings, often symbolises the subconscious—the deep, impressionable part of us where beliefs are stored. So this “fool” is one whose inner convictions are rooted in separation, disbelief, and limitation.</p>
<p><strong>2. “Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.”</strong><br />
“Iniquity,” to Neville, isn’t about moral failure in the religious sense—it’s missing the mark, a self-wounding by falling on one's sword. Anyone who denies the imagination as God is corrupt <em>in their perception</em>; they believe in external causation and thus live a life of reaction and error. “None that doeth good” echoes the idea that, without knowledge of the truth of being—<em>that I AM is God</em>—we cannot align with good, because we look for it externally rather than assuming it within.</p>
<p><strong>3. “God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.”</strong><br />
“Heaven,” to Neville, is not a distant place, but the state of consciousness. “God looked down” symbolises divine awareness seeking recognition within man. It’s like saying: <em>Is anyone conscious that their own awareness is God?</em> “Seeking God” is the inner journey toward discovering that your own “I AM-ness” is the source.</p>
<p><strong>4. “Every one of them is gone back... there is none that doeth good.”</strong><br />
This reflects how humanity tends to revert to belief in external powers, despite having glimpses of truth. “Gone back” means slipping into the old state of consciousness—believing in the world of facts rather than the creative power of assumption. To Neville, until one awakens to the truth that <strong>imagination is God</strong>, all attempts fall short of true good.</p>
