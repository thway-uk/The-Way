<h1>John 11:26: Jesus' question—“Is this your faith?”</h1>
<p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death. Is this your faith?”</em></blockquote><p></p>
<h3><strong>Neville Goddard's Interpretation</strong></h3>
<p>To Neville, this verse is not about physical immortality, but <strong>spiritual aliveness</strong>—<strong>staying consciously identified with your divine creative power</strong>, which he called the imagination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Living”</strong> represents being spiritually awake—aware that <em>I AM</em> (your imagination) is God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Faith in me”</strong> means faith in this truth: that your inner world shapes the outer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Will never see death”</strong> means you will never again <strong>fall into the dead state</strong> of believing in external causes, fear, or limitation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus' question—<em>“Is this your faith?”</em>—is a challenge to the reader:<br />
<strong>Do you truly believe that your imagination creates reality?</strong><br />
Or do you still fear circumstances, reacting as if you're powerless?</p>
<p>To have this faith is to remain in the living state—where you revise, assume, and create—never dying to the truth of who you really are.</p>
