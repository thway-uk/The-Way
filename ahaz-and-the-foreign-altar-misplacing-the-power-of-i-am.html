    <h1>Ahaz and the Foreign Altar: Misplacing the Power of 'I AM'</h1>
    <p></p><p><em>An interpretation of 2 Kings 16 through the teachings of Neville Goddard</em></p><p>In <strong>2 Kings 16</strong>, King Ahaz of Judah misplaces his creative power by turning to external belief systems instead of trusting his inner power. This chapter symbolises what happens when imagination—the true altar of God—is replaced by external dependency.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Ahaz: The Possessor of Creative Power</strong></h3><p><strong>Name meaning:</strong> Ahaz (אָחָז) – "He has grasped" or "Possessor"</p><p>Ahaz represents a state of consciousness that misdirects its energy and praise. Instead of grounding himself in the inner power of "I AM," he turns to <strong>Assyria</strong>, symbolising a reliance on external, worldly belief systems. As "the possessor," Ahaz has the creative power but uses it destructively, grasping onto false beliefs and surrendering his imagination to the external world.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Your own wonderful human imagination is God."</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Ahaz’s name highlights the idea of possessing creative power, yet he misuses it by placing his trust in external systems, losing his connection to the true source within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Assyria: The Outer World</strong></h3><p><strong>Name meaning:</strong> Ashur (אַשּׁוּר) – "Level," "Plain," also a god of war</p><p>To turn to Assyria is to rely on the visible, rational world—external validation and systems. Ahaz sends gold and silver to Assyria, symbolising the surrender of his spiritual wealth to outer forces, rather than trusting his imagination to create from within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Son Through Fire: Sacrificing Potential</strong></h3><p>Ahaz “made his son pass through the fire,” symbolising the sacrifice of his own future potential. In Neville’s teachings, the son represents the ideal wish fulfilled—the desired creation. By turning to external beliefs, Ahaz sacrifices his potential future, misdirecting his creative energy.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Sin means to miss the mark. You sin every time you imagine what you do not want."</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>In choosing external beliefs, Ahaz destroys his own creative potential, allowing his future vision to be consumed by misaligned energy.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Foreign Altar: Replacing the Inner God</strong></h3><p>When Ahaz installs a foreign altar in the temple, he symbolises replacing the inner power of imagination with external belief systems. <strong>Damascus</strong> represents foreign ideologies that, while appearing impressive, are rooted in separation and misalignment.</p><p>By abandoning the true altar—the "I AM" within—Ahaz chooses a false system, leading him further away from his own creative power.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Urijah the Priest: The Subconscious in Service</strong></h3><p><strong>Name meaning:</strong> Urijah (אוּרִיָּה) – "My light is Yah"</p><p>Urijah the priest obediently builds the foreign altar, symbolising the subconscious mind that faithfully follows the conscious directives. Whatever is believed to be true is accepted by the subconscious and brought into reality.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Your subconscious accepts as true that which you feel to be true."</em> – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>When we misdirect our energy, the subconscious (Urijah) builds realities that align with false beliefs, creating an altar of misalignment.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: A Warning and a Choice</strong></h3><p>You are Ahaz when you turn from imagination to external belief systems. You are Urijah when your subconscious builds what you don’t want by accepting false beliefs. You are the son passed through the fire when you sacrifice your dream for external validation.</p><p>But you are also David when you remember who you truly are.</p><p>The altar belongs within. The temple is your mind. The only true offering is a new assumption, made real through feeling. The only true priest is your attention. The only kingdom worth ruling is the inner one.</p><p>Return to the altar of "I AM," and you will find that Judah (Praise) is restored, and your son (the ideal wish fulfilled) lives again.</p><p><br /></p>
