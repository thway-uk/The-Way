    <h1>Target For Aim: The Cross and The Mark</h1>
    <p>In the realm of Neville Goddard’s teachings, symbols like the cross, the arrow, and the mark are not just metaphors; they are profound representations of the manifestation process. These symbols illustrate how our inner beliefs and assumptions intersect with the external world to create our reality.</p><h3>The Cross: Intersection of Inner Belief and Outer Reality</h3><p>The cross symbolises the point where our inner state of being—our beliefs, assumptions, and imagination—intersects with the external world. The vertical line represents our inner consciousness, while the horizontal line signifies the external manifestations of our thoughts. The cross, therefore, is the symbol of manifestation itself—the moment when our inner assumptions materialise in the physical world.</p><h3>The Arrow: Aiming with Focused Intention</h3><p>The arrow represents our focused intention or desire. In the process of manifestation, aiming the arrow symbolises directing our thoughts and beliefs toward a specific goal. The act of shooting the arrow is akin to assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, propelling our desire into the universe with confidence and faith.</p><h3>Sin as "Missing the Mark"</h3><p>In biblical terms, sin is often described as missing the mark. This concept aligns with the idea that when our thoughts and beliefs are not in harmony with our desires, we fail to manifest our goals. Missing the mark signifies a misalignment between our inner state and our desired outcome. In Neville's framework, sin is self-sabotage—a result of directing our thoughts and assumptions away from what we truly desire.</p><h3>Hitting the Mark: Successful Manifestation</h3><p>Conversely, hitting the mark represents the successful alignment of our inner beliefs with our desires, resulting in the manifestation of our goals. It's the moment when our focused intention (the arrow) meets the desired outcome (the mark), facilitated by the intersection point (the cross) where inner belief and outer reality converge.</p><h3>The Story of David and Jonathan: A Symbolic Illustration</h3><p>The narrative of David and Jonathan in 1 Samuel 20 offers a vivid illustration of these symbols in action. Concerned for David's safety, Jonathan devises a plan to communicate the danger posed by King Saul without arousing suspicion. He tells David:</p><p>“I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,’ then come, because, as surely as the Lord lives, you are safe; there is no danger. But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, because the Lord has sent you away.”<br />
—1 Samuel 20:20–22 NIV</p><p>Jonathan's act of shooting the arrow beyond the boy serves as a symbolic message to David, indicating that he must flee for his safety. This act encapsulates the essence of aiming with intention and hitting the mark—Jonathan's arrow, directed with purpose, conveys a critical message that alters David's course of action.</p><h3>The Scribe and the Mark of Lamentation</h3><p>In Ezekiel 9, a scribe is commanded to mark the foreheads of those who lament and mourn over the abominations of the city. This is a powerful symbol that underscores the importance of assuming the wish fulfilled. Those marked by the scribe represent individuals who are emotionally engaged in what they lack or what is wrong in the world. Lamentation, in this case, symbolizes focus on the negative, which keeps them out of alignment with their desires.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, those marked by lamentation are not assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Instead of focusing on their desires as already manifested, they focus on their present limitations and struggles. This results in an emotional alignment that perpetuates missed opportunities for manifestation, as they continue to be governed by lack rather than abundance.</p><h3>The Mark of the Beast: Self-Wounding and Missing the Mark</h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, sin is equated with missing the mark, and we can interpret the mark of the beast as symbolic of self-inflicted suffering. Those who carry the mark of the beast have metaphorically shot the arrow into themselves, focusing their attention on limiting beliefs, fears, and negativity. They have allowed self-sabotage to take root, perpetuating a cycle of disempowerment.</p><p>This concept of self-wounding fits perfectly within Neville’s framework, where self-sabotage is the result of not aligning one’s inner state with their desires. The person who carries the mark has essentially marked themselves with limiting assumptions, continually missing the mark by focusing on what they do not want. The mark of the beast is not a literal physical mark but rather a symbol of misalignment, where the person is dominated by the beast—the unconscious mind full of negative influences and assumptions.</p><h3>Jesus: The Embodiment of the Manifestation Process</h3><p>Jesus, within Neville Goddard’s framework, is the embodiment of all the symbols we’ve discussed: the cross, the arrow, and the mark. Jesus represents the perfect alignment between inner beliefs and outer reality. His life, teachings, and ultimately, his sacrifice on the cross serve as the ultimate demonstration of how inner assumptions, when fully aligned with one’s desires, manifest in the physical world.</p><p>The cross, representing the intersection of inner belief and external manifestation, is most fully realised in Jesus’ experience. In his crucifixion, he takes on the weight of humanity’s negative assumptions, illustrating how limiting beliefs can be overcome. His death and resurrection signify the transformation from misalignment (sin) to perfect manifestation. Just as the arrow is shot with intention, Jesus' life is an example of focused desire and assumed fulfillment, from his birth through to his death on the cross and his resurrection.</p><p>Moreover, Jesus embodies the act of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled to the highest degree. His prayers and affirmations, especially the ones he made before his crucifixion, demonstrated complete trust in the divine will and a deep belief that he was destined to fulfil his purpose. His mark is not the mark of sin, but the mark of ultimate alignment with the divine blueprint.</p><p>Jesus, as the perfect man, symbolises the power of imagination and the creative force that exists within each of us. His life offers us the ultimate blueprint for how to manifest consciously by aligning our inner thoughts and assumptions with our desires, living in accordance with the principle of assuming the wish fulfilled.</p><h3>Integrating the Symbols: A Unified Perspective</h3><p>By weaving together the symbols of the cross, the arrow, and the mark, and illustrating them through the story of David and Jonathan, we gain a deeper understanding of the manifestation process:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The cross represents the intersection where our inner beliefs meet external reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arrow symbolises our focused intention and desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mark is the target—our desired outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitting the mark signifies the successful manifestation of our desires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing the mark (sin) indicates a misalignment between our beliefs and desires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mark of the beast represents self-sabotage, where the person has unconsciously directed negative thoughts inward, creating suffering and disempowerment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus embodies the perfect alignment with the creative power of imagination, exemplifying the manifestation process in its fullest form.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Aligning with Neville Goddard’s Teachings</h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the act of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled is the key to manifestation. Self-sabotage—symbolised by the mark of the beast—occurs when we allow our beliefs to be misaligned with our desires. The solution, therefore, is to consciously redirect our thoughts, focus on positive assumptions, and shoot the arrow toward the desired outcome. This aligns our inner beliefs with our desires, ensuring that we hit the mark and manifest the reality we wish to create.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Understanding and aligning these elements empowers us to consciously create our reality, ensuring that our arrows of intention consistently hit their marks. By avoiding the self-sabotage represented by the mark of the beast, and assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, we can manifest the life we desire. The cross, the arrow, and the mark serve as powerful symbols of our creative process, reminding us of the importance of focused intention, aligned belief, and the conscious direction of our thoughts and desires.</p><p>































</p><p>Moreover, by understanding that Jesus is the embodiment of these principles, we see that the ultimate manifestation is aligning ourselves completely with the divine power of imagination, just as he did, and trusting that our desires are already fulfilled within the fabric of our consciousness.</p><p><strong>Side note:</strong> The <em>Vitruvian Man</em> is an image that comes to mind when visualising the crucifixion and the law of assumption. It symbolises the internal alignment of the inner and outer man, where the cross represents the intersection of these two dimensions—inner beliefs and external reality. Just as the figure is perfectly proportioned and balanced, the law of assumption requires this same balance to manifest the desired outcome.</p>
