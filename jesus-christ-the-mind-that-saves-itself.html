He represents the mind that, recognising its creative power, assumes the end and thereby saves itself from limitation. This is the essence of the Law of Assumption: what you assume to be true of yourself, with feeling, hardens into fact.</p><p>But <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a> does not emerge in isolation—he is the culmination of every state of awareness described throughout the Bible. From the spirit that hovered over the waters in Genesis—symbolising unformed potential—through <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Abraham’s faith, Jacob’s persistence, Joseph’s imaginative rulership</a>, Moses’ inner law, and David’s embodiment of divine favour, the Bible charts an <a href="/2025/07/the-bibles-true-timeline-evolution-of.html">inner psychological evolution</a>. Each figure and event is a symbolic movement of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>, leading toward the full awakening of man’s identity as God.</p><p>Jesus is the final state in this inward journey—the moment the individual fully identifies as the creator of their own reality. The crucifixion symbolises the fixing of an assumption, and the resurrection is the rising into the assumed state. Salvation is not external but happens within, when the mind accepts, “I and my Father are one”—that imagination (the Son) and consciousness (the Father) are united.</p><p>One striking feature of Jesus’ story is the immediacy with which he heals negative conditions. Time and again in the Gospels, when Jesus commands healing or speaks a word of restoration, the change happens “immediately” or “at once.” For example:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>When Jesus touches a leper and says, “Be clean,” the leprosy vanishes immediately (Matthew 8:3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Jesus commands a paralyzed man, “Rise, pick up your bed and walk,” the man immediately stands and walks (Luke 5:24-25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law instantly after touching her hand (Mark 1:30-31).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Jesus speaks to a blind man, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,” the man receives his sight without delay (John 9:6-7).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These <a href="/search/label/Time%20Series">immediate</a> healings illustrate how quickly a shift in assumption, a new inner belief, transforms outer reality. They are vivid demonstrations of the Law of Assumption in action - the instant dismissal of limitation through the conscious <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">assumption of a desired state</a>.</p><p>To believe in Jesus, then, is not to cling to a story, but to walk the inner path of self-recognition. Jesus is the pattern of realization that unfolds in all of us when we stop reacting to the world and begin imagining deliberately.</p><p>He is the mind that saves itself—not through penance or ritual, but through the conscious <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">assumption of the state desired</a>. The Bible is the map; Jesus is the summit.</p><blockquote>“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”<br />
—Colossians 1:27</blockquote>
