<h1>When Disciples Unfollow – A Neville Goddard Take on John 6:65–66</h1>
<blockquote><p><strong>65</strong> And he said, <em>Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</em><br />
<strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.<br />
— <em>John 6:65–66 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>From a <strong>Neville Goddard</strong> perspective, Jesus represents the <strong>awakened imagination</strong>—that part of you which knows it is the creative power of God. The “Father” is your <strong>deeper self</strong>, the formless, unconditioned <strong>I AM</strong> that quickens that realisation from within.</p><p>And this passage? It’s one of those moments where the crowd goes quiet, someone coughs awkwardly, and then half the group leaves.</p><h3>The Inner Unfollow</h3><p><strong>“No man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.”</strong></p><p>Neville would say this means you can’t truly accept that <strong>your imagination is God</strong> unless it has been stirred from the depths of your own being. It’s not something that can be forced or taught from the outside. It must be <strong>revealed inwardly</strong>—by your own I AM.</p><p>Without that revelation, the teaching sounds extreme, even offensive. And so, as the verse says, <strong>“many of his disciples went back”</strong>. That’s what happens when imagination steps up and says: <em>“Actually, I’m God.”</em> Not everyone’s ready for that promotion.</p><h3>Judah and Judas: The Moment of Recognition</h3><p>Let’s talk <strong>Judah</strong>. The same Judah who slept with Tamar thinking she was a harlot, then tried to have her burned when she turned up pregnant. Classic hypocrisy—until <strong>Tamar reveals she’s pregnant by him</strong>.</p><p>In that moment, Judah says:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“She is more righteous than I.”</em><br />
<em>(Genesis 38:26)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This isn’t just a dramatic plot twist. In Neville’s symbolic interpretation, <strong>Tamar is the imaginative act</strong>—bold, persistent, and veiled. Judah represents the outer man, the one who didn’t recognise her at first. But when he says <em>she is more righteous</em>, he is admitting that <strong>imagination (Tamar)</strong> is the true creative force—<em>more just, more right, more aligned with divine law than the old self</em>.</p><p>That’s the inner shift Neville spoke of: when you realise it’s not your effort, your morality, or your external religion—it’s <strong>imagination</strong>, veiled and persistent, that brings forth life.</p><p>Now enter <strong>Judas</strong>.</p><p>He too recognises Jesus—that is, <strong>recognises imagination as God</strong>—but recoils. Judas symbolises that part of us that sees the power but cannot handle the implications. He hands over imagination to be crucified—to be fixed in consciousness—triggering a transformation that, though painful, is essential.</p><p>So we have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah</strong>, who recognises imagination as righteous and accepts it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judas</strong>, who recognises it and gives it up as the operant power.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Both see the truth and <strong>both acknowledge it</strong>. They serve the same purpose: moving the self towards full recognition of the creative power within.</p><h3>Not Everyone’s Ready</h3><p>So when many disciples “walked no more with him,” they represent the thoughts, beliefs, and identities that were never going to survive the truth that <strong>imagination is Lord</strong>. It’s too confronting. Too demanding. Too… <em>you</em>.</p><p>But those who stay?<br />
They’re the ones ready to <strong>praise the inner Tamar</strong>, to stand by the imaginative act, no matter how veiled or scandalous it might appear.</p>
