<title>Manifesting a New Me—But Facebook Has Other Plans</title>

<h1>Manifesting a New Me—But Facebook Has Other Plans</h1>
<p>So, I’ve decided to assume a new state of being. I’m leaving behind my old Facebook account (and all its embarrassing posts) and starting fresh. I mean, why not? I’m practically a new person, right? Well, apparently Facebook doesn’t agree.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Facebook Thinks I’m Suspicious (And Not in a Cool Way)</h3>
<p>I closed my old account to make space for the new me—brand new, no baggage, all positive vibes. But when I tried to open my shiny, new Facebook profile, I was met with a cold, digital “Suspicious Activity Detected” message. Facebook’s not convinced I’m actually a real person, let alone a fresh identity.</p>
<p>It's like when you try to manifest your dream life, and the universe sends you a “Hey, not so fast!” notice. <strong>“Show me proof that you’re ready to be the awesome version of yourself,”</strong> the world says. Facebook wants to see my “identity verification” and my “proof of transformation.” Spoiler alert: I'm still waiting.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Facebook: The Lord of the Flies of Social Media</h3>
<p>Let’s be real—Facebook is like the Beelzebub of the internet, full of people who think they have no power. And just like the "Lord of the Flies" mentality, this leads to a toxic feedback loop of negativity and low self-worth. Facebook is like a jungle of mindless chatter, where people get stuck in the belief that they’re powerless.</p>
<p>Even Lady Gaga has called social media "trash"—and honestly, who can blame her? The whole place seems to be crawling with people who have no idea how much power they <em>really</em> have. Instead of manifesting their dreams, they’re stuck in a loop of negativity, and it’s contagious.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Trying to Manifest a New Identity? Good Luck</h3>
<p>This whole thing got me thinking: manifesting a new identity is exactly like trying to get Facebook to accept the new <em>you</em>. You know who you want to be, but when you try to step into that new state of being, the world says, <strong>“Nope, not yet. Show me more proof.”</strong> It's like Facebook won’t let me be my new, upgraded self.</p>
<p>It’s frustrating, but here’s the kicker: the real resistance isn’t Facebook—it’s the old state of mind that says, <strong>“You’re not ready for the new you.”</strong> You get stuck in the past, and the universe (or Facebook) just keeps throwing up obstacles.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Breaking Through: The Power of Persistence</h3>
<p>But here’s the trick: persistence is key. Just like Neville Goddard teaches us about imagining the wish fulfilled, I’ve got to imagine that Facebook is already on board with my transformation. I don’t need their approval to be my new self. The universe might not hand you everything on a silver platter, but if you keep assuming the new state, it’ll eventually <em>show up</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: Facebook Can Keep Its Suspicious Alerts</h3>
<p>So, yeah, Facebook may think I’m suspicious—and maybe I am. Suspiciously <em>awesome</em>. But no matter how many “Suspicious Activity” alerts pop up, I’m staying firm. I’ll keep manifesting my new identity, and eventually, the world will catch up.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll just keep imagining that Facebook finally accepts me for who I really am: someone too cool for the rules.</p>
