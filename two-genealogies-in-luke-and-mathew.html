    <title>Two Genealogies in Luke and Mathew</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Two Genealogies in Luke and Mathew</h1>
    <p>"The Gospels of <strong>Luke</strong> and <strong>Matthew</strong> both present genealogies of Jesus, but they differ significantly in <strong>structure, order, and emphasis</strong>. These differences are not merely historical curiosities or literary preferences — they carry deep <strong>symbolic meaning</strong>, aligning beautifully with <strong>Neville Goddard’s teaching on the Law of Assumption</strong>: <em>that what we inwardly accept as true will eventually unfold in our outer world.</em></p><hr /><h2><strong>Luke’s Genealogy: The Path of Universal Consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>Luke 3:23–38</strong> <a href="/2025/06/lukes-genealogy-lineage-to-god.html">traces Jesus’ lineage</a> <strong>backward</strong>, beginning with Jesus and ending with <strong>Adam</strong>, “the son of God.” This reverse progression is unique in the New Testament and rich in symbolic depth.</p><h3><strong>Starting Point: Jesus as the Present State of Consciousness</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s teaching, Jesus represents the fully realised <em>“<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>”</em> — the awakened awareness of being. Luke begins with this state and moves <strong>inward</strong>, suggesting that the journey of consciousness begins with our present assumption and returns to its source.</p><h3><strong>Backward Journey: Returning to Universal Origins</strong></h3><p>By tracing the lineage back to Adam and then to <strong>God</strong>, Luke symbolises the inward journey to the <strong>universal “I AM.”</strong> It’s the path of remembering — a return to the divine origin of imagination, beyond time, tribe, or tradition.</p><h3><strong>Names as Stages of Conscious Development</strong></h3><p>Each Hebrew name in Luke’s genealogy carries a <strong>meaning</strong> — such as “praise,” “gift,” “comfort,” or “help” — representing states or stages in the unfolding of inner awareness. Rather than historical figures, these names can be understood as <strong>symbolic markers</strong> in the refinement and unification of consciousness.</p><blockquote>
<p>This journey mirrors the shepherd in Neville’s symbolic framework — the mind gathering its scattered thoughts into <strong>one unified flock</strong>, the assumption that becomes flesh.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Matthew’s Genealogy: The Path of External Manifestation</strong></h2><p>In contrast, <strong>Matthew 1:1–17</strong> <a href="/2025/05/the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">traces the lineage</a> <strong>forward</strong>, beginning with <strong>Abraham</strong> and progressing through <strong>David</strong> to Jesus.</p><h3><strong>Beginning with Faith and Divine Promise</strong></h3><p>Abraham represents <strong>faith</strong> — the initial moment of spiritual confidence when one assumes a desire to be true, without outer evidence. This is the planting of the seed in imagination.</p><h3><strong>Structured Unfolding: Faith into Form</strong></h3><p>Matthew’s forward progression reflects the <strong>structured unfolding of assumption into form</strong>. It emphasises external events: covenant, kingship, and fulfilment. Each generation is a step forward in the <strong>external realisation</strong> of the internal assumption begun in Abraham.</p><h3><strong>Three Sets of Fourteen</strong></h3><p>Matthew presents the lineage in <strong>three sections of 14 generations</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Abraham to David (faith to dominion),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David to the Babylonian exile (dominion to fall),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exile to Christ (fall to redemption).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>This numerical symmetry (14 = 2 × 7; 3 = fullness) represents the rhythm and order inherent in manifestation.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Key Structural Differences Between Luke and Matthew</strong></h2><table>

</table><hr /><h2><strong>Symbolic Interpretation Through the Law of Assumption</strong></h2><p>Neville taught that manifestation begins in the <strong>unseen</strong>, in a silent, assumed state. These two genealogies mirror the <strong>dual process</strong> of inner and outer creation.</p><h3><strong>Luke = Inner Assumption</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p>A path of <em>remembrance</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving backward to source (God).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflects <em>inner awareness</em> of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quiet, subconscious gathering of consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Matthew = Outer Manifestation</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p>A path of <em>fulfilment</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving forward through time and lineage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflects <em>faith</em>, action, and persistence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The external crystallisation of what was assumed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, they form the full cycle of manifestation:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“The kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17:21), and when it is assumed, it expresses itself through history — your personal Matthew genealogy of fulfilment.”</strong></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Conclusion: <a href="/2025/05/eden-within-two-trees-four-rivers-and.html">Two Trees</a>, One Root</strong></h2><p>The genealogies of <strong>Matthew</strong> and <strong>Luke</strong> are not contradictions; they are <strong>complementary symbolic blueprints</strong> of manifestation.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke shows the origin of the assumption</strong>: the <em>seed</em> planted in the heart, returning to the divine “I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew shows the fulfilment of the assumption</strong>: the <em>fruit</em> borne through faith, persistence, and structure.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Understanding both is crucial. To live the Law of Assumption is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inwardly identify</strong> with your desired state (Luke),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <strong>outwardly persist</strong> in its truth (Matthew).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the secret of divine creation — not history, but <strong>symbolic psychology</strong>, hidden in the story of Jesus.</p>
