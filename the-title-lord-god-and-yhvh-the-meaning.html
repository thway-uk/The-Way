<h1>The Title “Lord God” and YHVH: The Meaning</h1>
<p></p><blockquote>Lord (YHVH) — describes imagination occupying and identifying with a specific state of consciousness - the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a></blockquote><p></p><p>The name <strong><a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a></strong> is one of the most recognised and revered names in the world. Yet behind the simplicity of these five letters lies a profound spiritual mystery — a message of salvation, creation, and the process within each of us. When we explore its original <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew form</a> and examine it through Neville Goddard’s teachings on the Law of Assumption, we discover not a distant saviour but the living pattern of our own creative consciousness.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jesus: The Hebrew Origin and Hidden Meaning</strong></h3><p>In Hebrew, Jesus is:</p><p>יְהוֹשׁוּעַ (<em>Yehoshua</em>) or its shortened form יֵשׁוּעַ (<em>Yeshua</em>)</p><p>Both forms mean:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Yahweh is salvation”<br />
or more intimately: “The LORD saves” / “God saves”</p>
</blockquote><p>The name is composed of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yah" (יָה)</strong> — a shortened form of YHWH (the sacred Tetragrammaton, often rendered as Yahweh)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"yasha" (יָשַׁע)</strong> — to save, deliver, or rescue</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville taught that <strong>“<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>”</strong> (from Exodus 3:14) is the true name of God. Thus, in psychological terms, the name Jesus implies:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Jesus = “I AM” is salvation</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Your own awareness of being, your consciousness itself, is the saving power.</p><hr /><h3><strong>From Yeshua to Jesus: The Linguistic Journey</strong></h3><table>

</table><p>Though the letters transformed, the essential meaning — salvation through the presence of "I AM" — remained untouched.</p><hr /><h3><strong>YHVH: The Divine Pattern of Manifestation</strong></h3><p>The sacred name YHVH (יהוה) is much more than a title; it is a diagram of creation embedded within us. According to the Mather's Table of Hebrew correspondences and Neville’s interpretation, each letter unveils a stage in the creative process:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> — The seed, the spark of desire, the first impulse of imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> — The window, symbolising the inner conception and the imaginative scene felt as real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2025/05/the-nails-and-name-crucifixion-yhvh-and.html"><strong>Vav (ו)</strong> — The nail</a> or peg, the fixing of the idea in consciousness through feeling. Here, “feeling is the secret”; Vav is the mystical nail that binds the conception to reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> — The final expression, the manifestation, the world that mirrors the assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, the divine pattern unfolds as:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Yod → He → Vav → He</strong><br />
<strong>Desire → Conception → Fixation → Manifestation</strong></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>The “Lord” and “God”: Pattern and Presence</strong></h3><p>In the Bible, “Lord” (YHVH) represents the divine pattern or law of consciousness. “God” signifies <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM”</a> — the living self-awareness that chooses and assumes.</p><p>When we see the title <strong>“Lord God,”</strong> it signifies the union of pattern (YHVH) and presence (“I AM”). This is the moment when the inner assumed identity perfectly aligns with the divine pattern, activating the Law of Assumption and bringing the desired state into visible form.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Double “I AM” and the Father-Son Union</strong></h3><p>Exodus 3:14 states: <strong>“I AM that I AM.”</strong></p><p>Neville revealed that the <a href="/2025/05/the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">doubling of this phrase</a> symbolises two aspects of self:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The first <strong>“I AM”</strong> is the <strong>Father</strong> — the eternal, unchanging source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second <strong>“I AM”</strong> is the <strong>Son</strong> — the expressed, assumed identity that manifests in the world.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This reveals that you are both <a href="/2025/05/the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">source and expression</a> — the silent being and the living creator. Manifestation is not about reaching for something external but recognising that you are both the <a href="/2025/05/the-father-son-symbolism-in-bible.html">imaginer (Father) and the imagined (Son).</a></p><hr /><h3><strong>Jesus as Your Personal Blueprint</strong></h3><p>For Neville, Jesus is the embodiment of the awakened imagination. Rather than a distant figure to worship, Jesus symbolises your “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>” — your awareness as the saviour. You are not saved by begging an external deity but by boldly assuming the state you desire to experience.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Fourfold Pattern: Gospels and YHVH</strong></h3><p>The <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four letters of YHVH mirror the four Gospels</a>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew</strong> — Faith and fulfilment (Yod, seed of desire)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark</strong> — Action and persistence (He, inner conception)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke</strong> — Vision and compassion (Vav, fixing the feeling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John</strong> — Oneness and love (“I AM”) (final He, manifestation)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In every instance, "<a href="/search/label/Numbers%3A%20Four">four</a>" signifies completeness and the full creative arc from intention to embodiment — whether in <a href="/2025/05/the-four-rivers-of-eden-flowing-delight.html">Eden’s four rivers</a>, <a href="/2025/04/ezekiels-living-creatures-prophetic.html">Ezekiel’s four living creatures</a>, or the four Gospels.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Living as the “Lord God”</strong></h3><p>To embody "Lord God" is to consciously merge the divine pattern <a href="/search/label/YHVH%20Series">(YHVH)</a> with your self-awareness (“I AM”). When your identity as the Son aligns with the Father's pattern, you live as the true creator. You move beyond hoping and waiting; you assume, feel, and know.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Your awareness of being is God; the thing you are aware of being is the Son, bearing witness of God the Father.”</strong><br />
— Neville Goddard</p></blockquote><div style="text-align: left;"><span><!--more--></span></div><p>Initially in Genesis, God is called "Lord God" (often "Yahweh Elohim"), but after Adam and Eve disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit, <a href="/2025/04/the-fall-from-lord-god-to-just-lord.html">the title changes to simply "Lord" (or "Yahweh"). </a></p><hr /><h3><strong>Summary Table</strong></h3><table>

</table><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Inner Saviour</strong></h3><p>The name Jesus is not merely historical. It is an ever-present call to recognise that your “I AM” — your awareness — is your true saviour. The divine pattern of YHVH guides the inner journey: desire the state, conceive it, feel it as real, and see it reflected. In this understanding, Jesus becomes your own inner power to transform, and “Lord God” becomes the perfect union of divine law and personal consciousness.</p>
