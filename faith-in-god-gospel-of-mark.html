<h1>Faith in God: Gospel of Mark</h1>
<p>In <em>Mark 11:22–25</em>, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have faith in God. Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them… whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville Goddard interpreted this not as religious metaphor but as psychological instruction. “Have faith in God,” he taught, really means <em>have faith in your imagination</em>, for <em><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God and your own wonderful human imagination are one</a> and the same.</em> To Neville, the “mountain” is any seeming obstacle in the outer world — and the command to cast it into the sea is a call to <em>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</em>, regardless of appearances.</p>
<p>The key lies in Mark 11:24: “<em><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">believe that you have received it, and it will be yours</a></em>.” Neville taught this is not about begging or waiting — it’s about <em>living from the end</em>, inwardly accepting your desire as already true, and remaining faithful to that assumption. Doubt is simply the return to appearances; faith is the inner conviction that the imaginal act is real.</p>
<p>Even the final verse — “<em>forgive, if you have anything against anyone</em>” — ties in. Unforgiveness binds you to the past and to unwanted states. Letting go sets imagination free to create anew.</p>
<p>In Neville’s words: <em>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</em> Mark 11 is telling you how to use it.</p>
