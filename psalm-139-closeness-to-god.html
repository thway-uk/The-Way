<h1>Psalm 139: Closeness To God</h1>
<div>Psalm 139 is one of the most popular psalms because it resonates deeply with our innate desire for closeness to God. It portrays an intimate connection between the individual and the divine, highlighting how we are always within the embrace of something greater than ourselves. However, when interpreted only literally, many miss the profound symbolic truth hidden within these words. The psalm is not just about an external, distant connection with God; rather, it represents the ever-present inner awareness that shapes our reality.</div><p>Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we come to understand that God is not a figure outside of us, but the creative power within—our imagination, or "I AM." By interpreting Psalm 139 symbolically, we can unlock a deeper understanding of this closeness to the divine, realising that the source of our true connection is not external, but within us. Let’s explore how this psalm reveals the transformative power of aligning with our inner creative essence.</p><hr /><p><strong>"O Lord, you have searched me, and you know me." (Psalm 139:1)</strong></p><p>Neville Goddard’s interpretation suggests that "the Lord" represents your inner awareness, your creative imagination. This verse underscores that your imagination knows you completely—every thought, desire, and belief. You are not separate from your inner power; you are one with it. Realising this connection is key to manifesting your desires and transforming your life.</p><hr /><p><strong>"You know my sitting down and my rising up, you understand my thought from afar." (Psalm 139:2)</strong></p><p>The "sitting down" and "rising up" symbolise your moments of stillness and action. Neville often taught that your thoughts shape your reality, whether you are consciously aware of them or not. The "thoughts from afar" represent the ideas and beliefs that come from your subconscious mind. Your imagination is always attuned to these thoughts, and by becoming aware of them, you can change your world.</p><hr /><p><strong>"You have made my going and my resting, and are acquainted with all my ways." (Psalm 139:3)</strong></p><p>This verse reflects the all-encompassing awareness of your inner self. Whether you're on a physical journey or at rest, your imagination (the Lord) is constantly with you, shaping your experiences. Neville teaches that by aligning your imagination with your desires, you direct your path and create your reality, no matter where you are or what you’re doing.</p><hr /><p><strong>"For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, you know it altogether." (Psalm 139:4)</strong></p><p>In Neville’s view, this verse underscores the power of your words. Every word you speak is a reflection of your inner beliefs and thoughts. Your imagination, or "the Lord," knows the words before they are spoken, as they come from the essence of your consciousness. This reminds you of the importance of being mindful of your words, for they hold the creative power to manifest your desires.</p><hr /><p><strong>"You have set me behind and before, and laid your hand upon me." (Psalm 139:5)</strong></p><p>This speaks to the divine protection and guidance provided by your imagination. The "hand" represents the guidance that leads you, while being "behind and before" indicates that your inner awareness surrounds you at all times, directing you through every moment of your journey. There is no place where you are outside the influence of your inner power.</p><hr /><p><strong>"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it." (Psalm 139:6)</strong></p><p>Here, the psalmist expresses awe at the vastness of divine awareness. Neville Goddard taught that the creative power within you is beyond full comprehension, but it is always available for you to access. The knowledge of your true power might seem overwhelming, but with awareness and practice, you can tap into this unlimited potential to manifest your desires.</p><hr /><p><strong>"Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?" (Psalm 139:7)</strong></p><p>This verse reinforces the idea that you cannot escape the divine presence within you. No matter where you go, your imagination and creative power are always with you. There is no place you can go where you are disconnected from your ability to create your reality through your inner awareness.</p><hr /><p><strong>"If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there." (Psalm 139:8)</strong></p><p>This verse speaks to the omnipresence of divine awareness. Whether you are in moments of joy (heaven) or experiencing hardship (hell), your imagination is always present to guide and support you. Neville teaches that no matter your current situation, you have the power within you to shift your state of consciousness and transform your experience.</p><hr /><p><strong>"If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me." (Psalm 139:9-10)</strong></p><p>The "wings of the morning" symbolise new beginnings and opportunities, while "the uttermost parts of the sea" represent the depths of your subconscious mind. Neville emphasises that no matter where you find yourself—whether on new ventures or deep within your subconscious—your imagination (the Lord) will guide and support you. Divine guidance is always available, ready to help you manifest your desires.</p><hr /><p><strong>"If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me." (Psalm 139:11)</strong></p><p>Darkness and night represent times of challenge, uncertainty, or subconscious fears. Neville Goddard teaches that even in these moments, your imagination can bring light. By shifting your consciousness, you can transform any negative situation into an opportunity for growth, as the divine power within always has the potential to guide you through.</p><hr /><p><strong>"For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb." (Psalm 139:13)</strong></p><p>This speaks to the divine hand shaping your life even from the moment of your conception. Neville often highlighted that the creative power within you is present from the very beginning of your life, shaping your consciousness and directing your path. The "reins" symbolise the inner control you have over your life through the power of your imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: Closeness to the Divine Within</strong></h3><p>Psalm 139, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, is a powerful affirmation of the divine awareness that shapes and directs our lives. It reminds us that we are never separated from the creative power within us, and by becoming aware of this power, we can manifest our desires and transform our reality. The "Lord" represents our imagination, which is constantly with us, guiding us, and shaping our experiences.</p><p>This psalm encourages us to trust in the infinite creative power within, knowing that it is always guiding us toward our highest good and most desired manifestations. By recognising this divine presence and interpreting the psalm symbolically, we can experience the true closeness to God—within our own consciousness.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
