    <h1>Jesus and the Disciples: Parables to Plain Speech</h1>
    <div><blockquote><p><strong>"His disciples said, 'Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; by this we believe that you came from God.'"</strong> (John 16:29–30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before this, Jesus often said, </p><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"I have said these things to you in figures of speech; the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures but will tell you plainly about the Father."</strong> (John 16:25).</blockquote><p></p>
<p>Then He adds, </p><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"The Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>."</strong> (John 16:27).</blockquote><p></p>

<h3>Why Did They Suddenly Understand?</h3>
<p>Until this moment, the <a href="/2025/04/jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">disciples</a> did not fully grasp who Jesus truly was. In Neville Goddard’s teaching, <em>Jesus</em> symbolises <i>imagination</i> <i>used rightly</i>— the creative power within each of us.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus spoke in parables because that is how the people perceived Him — as something external, distant, and symbolic.</strong> They were not ready to see Him as their own inner power. Because of this outer perception, He spoke in stories and symbols rather than direct statements.</p>
<p>When the <a href="/2025/04/jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">disciples</a>' perception shifted, and they started to see Jesus as the animating presence within, He began to "speak plainly."</p>
<p>Their words, <strong>"Now we know that you know all things,"</strong> show they had awakened. They realised that the true creative power (Imagination) is within themselves, not an external figure to question or doubt.</p>
<p>This is why they suddenly moved from confusion to understanding: they shifted from seeing Jesus as an outside teacher to recognising that <em>He</em> (imagination used rightly) is the governing power.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Apostles as Aspects of Mind</h3>
<p>The apostles themselves symbolise different <a href="/2025/04/jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">aspects of your own mind</a>. In Neville’s interpretation, each one represents a mental faculty chosen to support your assumption — your chosen state of being.</p>
<p>When you decide to assume a new state (a new belief about yourself), these "apostles" or <a href="/2025/04/jesus-his-disciples-psychological-drama.html">faculties of the mind come together</a> to support and sustain that new state.</p>
<p>In this story, when the disciples (your mental faculties) finally understand and agree with Jesus (Imagination), it means your whole mind aligns with the assumption. This unity makes the new state feel real and possible, allowing it to express in your outer world.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Parables: Hidden Teachings About Us</h3>
<p>Jesus used parables because people were not yet ready to understand directly. When we don’t know that imagination creates reality, we see life as random and disconnected.</p>
<p>When we understand, we stop seeing these teachings as distant stories and start seeing them as practical instructions for using our own creative power.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Plain Speech: Direct Understanding</h3>
<p>When Jesus (Imagination) speaks plainly, there is no more confusion. We realise that <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">"I AM</a>" — our sense of being — is the key to creation. We no longer look <i>outside</i> for signs but understand that our thoughts and feelings shape our world.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Power of "I AM" and Imagination</h3>
<p>Neville taught that "<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>" is God. When you say <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">"I AM"</a>, you are announcing your creative power. Your Imagination shapes that declaration. By assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you impress it on your subconscious, and it manifests.</p>
<p>Jesus showed this power through His words and actions. When He said "I AM", He was showing the divine creative power that lives in us. We are meant to claim this same power.</p></div>
