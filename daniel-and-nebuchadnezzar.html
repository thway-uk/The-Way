<h1>Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar</h1>
<p>The biblical account of Daniel 4 is presented as a profound inner drama between the rulers, kings and judges that <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>make up the mind of God</b></a>. Through the lens of Neville Goddard's Law of Assumption, it symbolises the journey of the self from a state of prideful, outwardly-focused awareness to the recognition that <b><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">imagination</a></b>—awareness of being—is the only true ruler. The entire sequence, encompassing the dream, the subsequent fall, and eventual restoration, unfolds within the individual's <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>psychological landscape</b></a>. This chapter illuminates the inevitable collapse of any state founded upon the <b><a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">forgetfulness of the I AM,</a></b> and the profound peace that emerges when consciousness reclaims its rightful dominion.</p><h3>Daniel and Belteshazzar: The Inner Wisdom Within Outer Identity</h3><p>Within Daniel 4, Daniel is also identified by his Babylonian name, Belteshazzar, given to him by the king's officials. This duality is rich in symbolism: Daniel represents inner wisdom or higher awareness, while Belteshazzar signifies the <b><a href="/2025/05/divided-by-doctrine-confusion-of.html">framework of the external world's language and identity</a></b>. This serves as a potent reminder that the profound truth of imagination and conscious awareness is frequently obscured by outer conditioning. However, it is ultimately this inner voice that orchestrates the transformation of the self from a state of pride to one of genuine understanding.</p><h3>A Seemingly Praiseworthy Testimony: The Deception of Ego</h3><p>The opening verses of Daniel 4 (verses 1-3) might initially appear as a humble declaration of praise from King Nebuchadnezzar:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be increased to you.<br />
I thought good to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.<br />
How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his government is from generation to generation.”</p>
</blockquote><p>However, upon closer examination, this is not the voice of a transformed state. Instead, it's the voice of a <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html"><b>man</b></a> still entrenched in <b><a href="/2025/07/the-ego-and-true-i-am.html">ego</a></b>, cloaking his pride in spiritual language. The king remains on his throne, addressing the world from a position of external power and self-importance. His ostensible praise of the "Most High" is filtered through the very assumption that he alone is favored, exalted, and in control. In Neville's terms, this is not yet the "new <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html"><b>man</b></a>" speaking; it is the old state—proud and outwardly successful—on the precipice of dismantling. The "Most High" he refers to is not yet recognized as the I AM within, but is treated as a distant deity serving his personal agenda. This deceptive opening sets the stage not as a conclusion, but as a prelude to the impending fall, a false testimony from a false self awaiting humility.</p><h3>The Disturbance in the Comfort Zone</h3><p>Nebuchadnezzar's declaration,</p><blockquote>
<p>“I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:<br />
I saw a dream that made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me” (Daniel 4:4-5),</p>
</blockquote><p>symbolizes a superficial sense of control and satisfaction. The "palace" represents the structured identity he has meticulously built. Yet, a "dream" intrudes, serving as a disturbance emanating from the deeper self. In Neville's framework, this dream is the subconscious attempting to expose the instability or falseness of the king's current assumption. The king's assumption that he is the source of his power creates this troubling dream, a natural discomfort arising when one's reality is built on the false premise that the outer self is the cause, rather than the inner feeling.</p><h3>Seeking Interpretation from Outer Faculties</h3><p>In his distress, Nebuchadnezzar turns to external sources for understanding:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Therefore I made a decree to bring all the wise men of Babylon before me...<br />
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers... but they did not make known to me the interpretation” (Daniel 4:6-7).</p>
</blockquote><p>This turning to "outer wisdom" symbolizes reliance on human reasoning, intellectual knowledge, and external appearances. These faculties correspond to what Neville would call the senses and the rational mind. However, they fail to provide true insight because the origin and meaning of one's inner world cannot be explained by external logic. This failure marks a crucial turning point: when all external analysis proves futile, one is compelled to look inward.</p><h3>The Introduction of Daniel: The Mind Active in the Law</h3><p>It is</p><blockquote>
<p>“at last Daniel came before me... In whom is the spirit of the holy gods...<br />
for I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you...” (Daniel 4:8-9).</p>
</blockquote><p>Daniel, whose name signifies "<a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a> is my judge," embodies the inner creative faculty—imagination, as taught by Neville. He is described as possessing the "spirit of the holy gods," implying that his insights stem not from the external world but from an internal source. When all external avenues fail to resolve confusion, one must turn to the sole true revealer: imagination. "No secret troubles you" means that Daniel, or imagination, perceives clearly by looking through symbols rather than being confined by facts.</p><h3>The Vision of the Great Tree and Its Meaning</h3><p>The king recounts his vision:</p><blockquote>
<p>“I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth... the height of it was great...<br />
The beasts of the field had shadow under it... and the birds of the air dwelt in its branches...” (Daniel 4:10-12).</p>
</blockquote><p>This <a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">tree</a> represents the individual's "I AM"—the central assumption from which all of one's reality grows. Its placement "in the midst of the earth" signifies that one's inner state is the axis of their world. In its grandeur and dominance, it is the <b><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></b> (Genesis 2:9), outwardly impressive and governing both noble thoughts and base instincts, for "all things follow your assumption."</p><p>However, this assumption is rooted in duality—in judgment, pride, and separation—rather than in the pure, indivisible awareness of the <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM.</a> Though the world responds to it, it is not the <b><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a></b>. That deeper tree—the imagination aligned with truth—lies buried beneath it. Neville teaches that the outer man, the false self constructed on division, must be laid down so the <b><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a></b>—the awakened imagination—may rise from within. The commandment in</p><blockquote>
<p>“And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;<br />
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you must not eat,<br />
for when you eat from it you will certainly die,’” (Genesis 2:16-17)</p>
</blockquote><p>foreshadows the consequence of living from a dualistic, prideful awareness-of-being.</p><h3>The Descent of the Watcher and the Felling of the Tree</h3><p>Nebuchadnezzar's dream continues with the appearance of</p><blockquote>
<p>“a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven...<br />
Hew down the tree... shake off its leaves... let the beasts get away from under it...” (Daniel 4:13-14).</p>
</blockquote><p>This "watcher" represents the higher self, the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">observing consciousness</a> that recognises the illusion inherent in the proud state. It signifies the moment when the deeper mind initiates the dismantling of a false assumption. In Neville's terms, the current self-concept has reached its culmination and must "die" to allow a new state of being to emerge.</p><p>The act of cutting down the tree symbolizes the removal of a dominant, false assumption. The outer world, which was sustained by this assumption, will scatter and fragment—"the beasts get away." While this may manifest as a crisis or loss in the external world, it is, in fact, grace in disguise—a necessary breakdown to create space for truth.</p><h3>The Preservation of the Root</h3><p>Despite the felling of the tree, the command is given:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Nevertheless leave the stump... with a band of iron and brass... and let it be wet with the dew of heaven...” (Daniel 4:15).</p>
</blockquote><p>This signifies that while the false identity is removed, the core of creative power is never destroyed. The "tree stump" remains, meaning your inherent ability to assume and imagine is preserved, though temporarily bound by the "iron and brass." Being "<a href="/2025/05/abital-fountain-of-wisdom-and-renewal.html">wet with the dew of heaven</a>" symbolizes renewal from above—the subconscious absorbing the truth of being.</p><p>Symbolically, the tree that is cut down is the <b><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></b>—a proud and dualistic self-concept. But the remaining stump is the <a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html"><b>Tree of Life</b></a>, still rooted at the centre of being, awaiting restoration. This period is one of dormancy and preparation, where one is no longer living from the old state but is not yet fully restored. Neville would term this the "in-between stage," where the "old <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html"><b>man</b></a>" is dead, but the "new <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html"><b>man</b></a>" is not yet fully assumed.</p><h3>The Descent into the Animal Mind</h3><p>The decree continues:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him” (Daniel 4:16).</p>
</blockquote><p>The "heart" here represents the core of one's emotional nature—their assumed identity. This verse marks a descent into reactive, bestial consciousness, a state described as "sin" where, instead of creating from I AM, the individual lives by instinct, fear, and outer appearances. This is symbolic of the state where one forgets their inherent power and begins reacting to the world as if it were the cause. The "seven times" passing over him signifies a complete cycle, as "seven" symbolises spiritual completion, akin to the seven days of creation. This represents the inevitable unfolding of a false assumption and its ultimate dissolution.</p><h3>The Universal Message and Daniel’s Silence</h3><p>The</p><blockquote>
<p>“decree of the watchers” is made “so that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men...” (Daniel 4:17).</p>
</blockquote><p>This emphasises that this entire dream is not solely for Nebuchadnezzar, but for "the living"—all who are capable of spiritual awareness. It serves as a universal warning against identifying with the ego and forgetting the true source of power. The message is clear: power and rulership belong not to outer titles or worldly status, but to the Most High—one's own consciousness, the I AM.</p><p>Daniel's initial silence and sorrow,</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him.<br />
The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you.<br />
Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies” (Daniel 4:19),</p>
</blockquote><p>reflects the profound and inevitable nature of the coming fall. Imagination (Daniel) clearly perceives that the ego-based state is destined to collapse, and there is no way to avoid it. Daniel's wish that the dream be for Nebuchadnezzar's enemies is not a literal act of unkindness, but an internal resistance to letting go of a grand external identity. Neville would suggest this embodies the soul's compassion for the self—the fall is not relished, but it is essential. When one first becomes aware of how deeply entrenched they are in a false identity, it can be a profound shock, explaining Daniel's moment of silence.</p><h3>The Identity is Named and the Sentence Passed</h3><p>Daniel then plainly reveals the dream's meaning:</p><blockquote>
<p>“The tree that you saw… it is you, O king, that are grown and become strong…<br />
your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth” (Daniel 4:20–22).</p>
</blockquote><p>The tree is Nebuchadnezzar himself—his identity, his assumption of power and control. In Neville's framework, this signifies the dominant state of being, having grown immense and flourishing in the outer world, yet detached from its true source. "Unto heaven" and "to the ends of the earth" indicate that this assumption governs both lofty ideals and outer material conditions. However, it remains rooted in external glorification, not in conscious unity with the I AM. This is symbolically the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil—a self-concept built on division and pride. Nevertheless, even when cut down, the Tree of Life remains hidden in the stump: imagination is never destroyed, only buried beneath false identity. Neville teaches that the outer man—regardless of his apparent grandeur—must be laid down, as "the old man" must die before the "new man" (awakened imagination) can arise.</p><p>The natural consequence of this false assumption is then declared:</p><blockquote>
<p>“They shall drive you from men… and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field…<br />
till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever he will” (Daniel 4:23–25).</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a punishment, but a necessary correction enforced by the higher self (the "watchers"). Neville would describe this as the point where one's world begins to reflect a misalignment between their assumption and their truth. The king is cast down to dwell with the beasts—a state of reactive, unconscious mind, where one loses control, reacts to appearances, lives in fear or confusion, and feels separated from others. This state persists "until" the crucial realization dawns: that consciousness alone rules, not status, intellect, or wealth—but the inner assumption of being. The moment this inner realization clicks, the "madness" ends.</p><h3>The Hope in the Stump and A Call to Shift Assumption</h3><p>The profound promise lies in the command to</p><blockquote>
<p>“leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure unto you,<br />
after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule” (Daniel 4:26).</p>
</blockquote><p>Despite the collapse of the grand identity, the root—the capacity to assume—is preserved. Neville emphasises that imagination cannot be destroyed; it can only be misused or forgotten. This verse assures that once Nebuchadnezzar (or any individual) recognises that the "heavens" (the inner world of assumption) rule, their "kingdom" (their world, their life) will be restored. The Law of Assumption corrects rather than punishes, and once awareness returns to the understanding that one's world is oneself "pushed out," everything begins to realign and restore from within.</p><p>Daniel, representing inner knowing, offers counsel:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you…<br />
break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor;<br />
if it may be a lengthening of your tranquillity” (Daniel 4:27).</p>
</blockquote><p>"Break off thy sins" does not refer to moral failures in Neville's teaching, but to "missing the mark"—living from a false self-concept. "Righteousness" implies right thinking—assumptions aligned with divine truth: I AM is the power. "Mercy to the poor" suggests a softening of the rigid, self-serving ego—a shift from defining oneself by superiority to recognising the divine in all, even the "least." This is an invitation to humility and alignment, which could potentially postpone or lessen the intensity of the ego's fall.</p><h3>The Ego's Last Stand and Immediate Collapse</h3><p>Despite the warning,</p><blockquote>
<p>“All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.<br />
At the end of twelve months… the king spoke, and said,<br />
Is not this great Babylon, that I have built… by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?” (Daniel 4:28–30).</p>
</blockquote><p>A full cycle ("twelve months") passes, and the king reaffirms his original, false assumption:</p><blockquote>
<p>“I did this. I am the cause.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the core delusion Neville consistently warns against—believing the outer man is the source of his world. "By the might of my power" serves as the final declaration of separation from the I AM. The ego identifies with results, completely forgetting the consciousness that created them. This marks the last breath before the inevitable collapse.</p><blockquote>
<p>“While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven…<br />
The same hour was the thing fulfilled… he did eat grass as oxen…<br />
till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws” (Daniel 4:31–33).</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the very words trigger the collapse because the assumption behind them is utterly unsustainable. The inner law acts immediately when the soul is prepared for transformation. Eating grass and growing wild symbolize a complete loss of conscious control and a descent into pure reaction, instinct, and delusion. This is what Neville would describe as a state of forgetting one's true Self—living as a "beast among appearances." However, this state, no matter how low, is not a grave but a cocoon. The extreme distortion of form (feathers, claws) hints that transformation is actively taking place even in this chaotic period, much like a caterpillar's liquefaction before its rebirth.</p><h3>The Turning Point: "I Lifted Up Mine Eyes"</h3><blockquote>
<p>“At the last I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my understanding came back to me,<br />
and I gave praise to the Highest, and I gave glory to him who lives for ever...” (Daniel 4:34).</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the moment of profound awakening. "At the end of the days" signifies the culmination of a full spiritual cycle—the end of living under the illusion of separation. To "lift up mine eyes unto heaven" is to consciously turn one's awareness back toward the inner world—the unseen realm of assumption and imagination. Neville teaches that this inward movement is the genesis of all true change, the antithesis of prideful self-assertion.</p><p>With this shift in attention,</p><blockquote>
<p>“my understanding returned unto me.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This means the profound knowledge that I AM creates reality comes flooding back. Nebuchadnezzar begins to perceive the Eternal Self—not his external identity, but the Living One within. This newfound understanding triggers praise, not out of obligation, but from sheer awe:</p><blockquote>
<p>“I blessed the most High.”</p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville's terminology, this is the profound realisation that one's awareness of being is God, and that it reigns eternally.</p><h3>Unstoppable Power: "No One Can Stay His Hand"</h3><blockquote>
<p>“All the people of the earth are thought to be as nothing, and he does as he will among the armies of heaven, and among the people of the earth; and no man can hold back his hand, or say to him, ‘What are you doing?’” (Daniel 4:35).</p>
</blockquote><p>
















































































</p><p>Nebuchadnezzar now recognises that human personalities, roles, and societal structures are utterly powerless before consciousness. "The inhabitants of the earth" symbolize outer appearances—the world as it seems to be. Neville would assert that outer facts are mere shadows of inner assumptions, effectively "nothing" in the sense that their existence depends entirely on one's concept of self. "None can stay his hand" means that once a thing is assumed in imagination and persisted in, the Law operates through</p>
