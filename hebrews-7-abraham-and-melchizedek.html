<h1>Hebrews 7: Abraham and Melchizedek</h1>
<p>In the epistle to the Hebrews, the mysterious figure of <strong>Melchizedek</strong> is introduced as a <strong>priest-king</strong> with a reign and priesthood that transcend all earthly boundaries. The writer of Hebrews compares Jesus to Melchizedek, stating that Jesus is a <strong>priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek</strong> (Hebrews 7:17). This powerful statement invites us to explore what <strong>Melchizedek</strong> and his <strong>priesthood</strong> represent in the context of <strong>Neville Goddard’s teachings</strong> on imagination and assumption. Through Neville's lens, we can see that Hebrews 7 offers insight into the <strong>inner transformation</strong> of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> that comes with the recognition of your <strong>creative power</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Melchizedek: The Eternal Power of Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>Neville Goddard often emphasised that the <strong>kingdom of God</strong> is <strong>within</strong> you, and that <strong>imagination</strong> is the <strong>key</strong> to unlocking your potential. In this framework, <strong>Melchizedek</strong> serves as the symbol of the <strong>eternal, unchanging creative power</strong> that resides within every person—an infinite <strong>spiritual authority</strong> tied not to external lineage, law, or ritual, but to the <strong>inner consciousness</strong> of<strong> creation</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Melchizedek: Priest of the Inner Temple</strong></h4>
<p>In Hebrews 7, <strong>Melchizedek is described as having no beginning or end</strong>, and his priesthood is <strong>eternal</strong>. This timelessness points to the <strong>timeless nature of your own creative imagination</strong>. When you awaken to the <strong>truth of your imagination</strong>, you step into the <strong>Melchizedek-like priesthood</strong> within you—<strong>the creative power to shape your reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Melchizedek is not bound by the <strong>Levitical priesthood</strong>, which relies on physical descent. In contrast, the <strong>priesthood of Melchizedek</strong> transcends lineage and law, symbolising a deeper, spiritual authority that flows directly from <strong>the eternal nature of imagination itself</strong>. Neville would say that this is a <strong>powerful metaphor for the creative imagination</strong>, which is not dependent on your external circumstances but is rooted in your <strong>inner awareness</strong> of your divine potential.</p>
<h3><strong>Melchizedek: Meaning in Hebrew</strong></h3>
<p>The name <strong>Melchizedek</strong> comes from two Hebrew words:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Melek (מֶלֶךְ)</strong>, meaning <strong>"king"</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tzedek (צֶדֶק)</strong>, meaning <strong>"righteousness"</strong> or <strong>"justice"</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, <strong>Melchizedek</strong> translates as <strong>"King of Righteousness"</strong> or <strong>"King of Justice"</strong>. This aligns beautifully with Neville Goddard's teachings on the creative power of imagination, for <strong>righteousness</strong> can be understood as the alignment of one’s inner world—<strong>imagination</strong>—with the divine order of the universe. By recognising your <strong>inner kingdom</strong> of imagination, you tap into the <strong>righteousness</strong> that governs creation.</p>
<p>The significance of <strong>Melchizedek's</strong> name reinforces his role as the <strong>sovereign ruler of divine order and creative power</strong>. In Neville’s terms, this reflects the <strong>unshakable, eternal nature</strong> of the imagination's creative force within you, which is forever able to manifest your desires when aligned with divine principles.</p>
<h3><strong>Jesus as the Fulfilment of Melchizedek’s Priesthood</strong></h3>
<p>In Hebrews 7:24-25, it is stated that <strong>Jesus</strong> is a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchizedek. For Neville, this aligns with the idea that <strong>Jesus</strong> represents the <strong>fully awakened imagination</strong>, the <strong>Christ-consciousness</strong> that emerges when one fully realises their <strong>creative power</strong>. Just as <strong>Melchizedek</strong> was a priest-king over the city of <strong>Salem</strong>, which means <strong>peace</strong>, Jesus is the embodiment of the <strong>inner peace</strong> that comes with understanding the power of imagination.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard interprets <strong>Jesus' crucifixion</strong> as a <strong>moment of fixing an idea in the imagination</strong>—the process of deeply aligning with a desire and making it real through <strong>imagination</strong>. The priesthood of Melchizedek reflects this because it is <strong>eternal and unchanging</strong>, just as the creative power of the imagination, once awakened, becomes the <strong>eternal source</strong> from which you can manifest your reality.</p>
<h3><strong>Melchizedek and the Tithe: Offering Your Attention to Your Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>In Hebrews 7:2, we read that <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Abraham</a> gave Melchizedek a tenth of all</strong>. This <strong>tithe</strong> is symbolic of recognizing the <strong>superior power</strong> of the imagination. In Neville’s terms, the <strong>tithe</strong> can be seen as <strong>offering your attention</strong> to the power of imagination—the <strong>creative energy</strong> that manifests your desires. Just as Abraham acknowledges Melchizedek’s greater spiritual authority by giving him a tenth, you too must <strong>offer your focus and energy</strong> to the creative power within you.</p>
<p>When you recognise that your imagination is the <strong>source of your reality</strong>, you are essentially giving a <strong>spiritual tithe</strong>. You align yourself with the <strong>greater power</strong> within, allowing your desires to flow freely from the <strong>kingdom of imagination</strong> into the world of manifestation.</p>
<h3><strong>Melchizedek’s Priesthood: An Invitation to Awaken the Power Within</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>priesthood of Melchizedek</strong> is a <strong>call to awaken to the eternal power of your own imagination</strong>. In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, this means recognising that the <strong>power to create your reality</strong> is within you, not outside of you. Just as Melchizedek’s priesthood is not tied to any external law or ritual, so too is your creative power independent of external limitations. You are not bound by circumstances, past experiences, or limitations. Instead, you have the <strong>freedom</strong> to create your world by consciously directing your imagination.</p>
<p>Neville teaches that when you align with your <strong>inner creative power</strong>, you embody the <strong>priesthood of Melchizedek</strong>—you become the <strong>master of your own reality</strong>. This <strong>inner awakening</strong> is the key to stepping into the <strong>Christ-consciousness</strong> that allows you to shape your world with your imagination.</p>
<h3><strong>Jesus and Melchizedek: The Fulfilment of the Inner Journey</strong></h3>
<p>The connection between <strong>Jesus and Melchizedek</strong> in Hebrews 7 illustrates the <strong>inner journey of spiritual awakening</strong>. Just as Melchizedek represents the <strong>eternal creative power of imagination</strong>, Jesus is the embodiment of this power fully realised. The <strong>priesthood after the order of Melchizedek</strong> is an invitation to each individual to awaken their <strong>own Christ-consciousness</strong> and <strong>imagination</strong>, recognising that they, too, have the power to <strong>create their reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this lens, the <strong>Melchizedek priesthood</strong> becomes a <strong>metaphor for your own spiritual awakening</strong>. You are invited to <strong>step into the eternal</strong>—to recognise that your <strong>creative imagination</strong> is not limited by time, space, or external laws. The <strong>power of imagination</strong> is always available to you, and like Melchizedek, it is eternal, unchanging, and supreme.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Eternal Power of Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>In Hebrews 7, <strong>Melchizedek’s priesthood</strong> is used as a <strong>symbol of Jesus’ eternal power</strong>—the <strong>creative power of imagination</strong> that transcends all external limitations. Jesus, as the fully awakened imagination, is the <strong>realisation of the divine creative potential</strong> within each individual. By recognising your own <strong>creative power</strong> and aligning with the <strong>inner kingdom of imagination</strong>, you too can step into the <strong>priesthood after the order of Melchizedek</strong> and manifest your desires.</p>
<p>This powerful chapter in Hebrews is not just about <strong>external figures</strong>; it’s a <strong>call to awaken to the power within</strong>. Just as Melchizedek’s priesthood is eternal, so is your creative power. By aligning with this inner power, you unlock the ability to <strong>create your world</strong>—just as Jesus did, just as Melchizedek did, and just as you are called to do.</p>
