<h1>"I Rebuke You In The Name of Jesus!"</h1>
<p>Have you ever shared something <strong>empowering</strong> and <strong>clarifying</strong> only to be met with total confusion or, even more humorously, an <strong>outright rebuke</strong>? If you’ve ever tried to introduce Neville Goddard’s interpretation of the Bible to someone who holds a more traditional view, you might know exactly what I mean. And let me tell you—some of the reactions I’ve had are as funny as they are revealing.</p><h3><strong>The First Reaction: “I Rebuke You in the Name of Jesus!”</strong></h3><p>Now, I wasn’t expecting everyone to just accept Neville’s teachings and say, "Yes, that makes total sense." But I was a little surprised at how often the <strong>first thing</strong> I’d hear when sharing Neville’s ideas was: <strong>“I rebuke you in the name of Jesus!”</strong></p><p>It’s kind of funny, isn’t it? Here I am, sharing a perspective I find incredibly <strong>empowering</strong>—that <strong>imagination is the creative power</strong>, and that the Bible is a <strong>symbolic guidebook</strong> to awakening—and I’m met with, well, a <strong>rebuke</strong>. At first, I didn’t understand it. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised that this reaction wasn’t as much about me or my ideas—it was about <strong>where people’s minds were at</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Blind Faith: The Real Comedy</strong></h3><p>What I was offering wasn’t meant to attack anyone’s beliefs or undermine their faith. In fact, I truly believe Neville’s teachings have the potential to <strong>empower</strong> anyone willing to explore them. The Bible, when seen through Neville’s lens, is a treasure trove of <strong>spiritual symbolism</strong>, where <strong>Jesus</strong> represents the <strong>imagination</strong> within us all, and <strong>David</strong> represents our awakening to the divine.</p><p>But for those who are deeply rooted in a <strong>literal interpretation</strong> of the Bible, it’s hard to see this. That’s when I started to realise: the <strong>rebukes</strong> weren’t personal. They were simply the result of <strong>blind faith</strong>—an attachment to a particular understanding of the Bible that leaves little room for new interpretations. And while that faith is <strong>valuable</strong>, it can sometimes be limiting.</p><h3><strong>Side Note: The Apostle's Rebuke</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, we see in the New Testament that even one of the apostles, <strong>Paul</strong>, rebuked someone for trying to hinder the spread of truth. In <strong>Acts 13:8-11</strong>, Paul rebukes a false prophet named Elymas, calling him a "child of the devil" and declaring that he would be struck blind for his opposition to the gospel. While this story isn’t directly about <strong>blind faith</strong>, it highlights the presence of <strong>opposition to spiritual truths</strong> in the early church. And much like the rebukes I encountered when sharing Neville’s interpretations, it shows how challenging it can be to move beyond a <strong>fixed perspective</strong>.</p><p>But the key takeaway here is not the <strong>rebuke itself</strong>, but the realization that <strong>new ideas</strong> or <strong>perspectives</strong> often face resistance—whether in the Bible or in our own lives. Change, or awakening, isn’t always met with open arms, but it doesn’t invalidate the truth.</p><h3><strong>The Real Joke: It’s About Perspective</strong></h3><p>Here’s where the <strong>comedy</strong> really kicks in: I wasn’t suggesting anything radical or disrespectful. I was simply offering a way to <strong>unlock the deeper meanings</strong> of the Bible and see it as a map for our <strong>spiritual awakening</strong>. Yet, the rebuke would come, as if the very idea of <strong>imagination</strong> as the divine power was somehow threatening.</p><p>Now, looking back, I realise that the real joke is how <strong>attached</strong> people can become to their <strong>way of seeing things</strong>. And I don’t say that with any sense of superiority—I’ve been there too. <strong>Blind faith</strong> is a powerful force, and it can be hard to let go of long-held beliefs, especially when they’ve been comforting for so long.</p><h3><strong>The Shift: Seeing the Bigger Picture</strong></h3><p>What I’ve come to understand is that these <strong>rebukes</strong> don’t reflect the <strong>truth</strong> of the message—it reflects <strong>where the person is in their journey</strong>. Sometimes, people are just <strong>not ready</strong> to see things from a different perspective. And that’s okay. <strong>Everyone is on their own path</strong>, and we all awaken in our own time.</p><p>So, if you ever find yourself in the same position—sharing something that feels empowering but being met with confusion or even a rebuke—don’t take it personally. It’s not about you; it’s about <strong>where they are in their own awakening</strong>. Their faith, while beautiful, can sometimes <strong>blind them</strong> to a bigger perspective, but that doesn’t make the truth any less powerful.</p><h3><strong>Final Laugh: The Comedy of Awakening</strong></h3><p>In the end, the <strong>humor</strong> isn’t in ridiculing anyone’s beliefs, but in seeing how <strong>attachment</strong> to a particular interpretation can prevent us from seeing the deeper <strong>empowering</strong> truths that are waiting for us. <strong>Blind faith</strong>, when not examined, can keep us stuck in a narrow view of what’s possible. But once that attachment is loosened—even just a little—everything starts to shift.</p><p>I don’t say any of this to be superior, but just to share what I’ve learned. <strong>The truth</strong> Neville offers isn’t meant to take anything away from people’s faith; it’s meant to <strong>add to it</strong>. To help unlock <strong>spiritual power</strong> and <strong>awaken</strong> to something even more beautiful than we imagined.</p><p>So, if you’re ever <strong>rebuked</strong> for offering a new perspective, remember this: <strong>it’s not about you</strong>. It’s just a natural part of the journey. And when the time is right, they’ll see things from a new light—just like I did. And maybe, we’ll all look back and laugh at how <strong>blind faith</strong> once kept us from seeing the full truth.</p>
