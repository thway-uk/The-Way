    <h1>Genesis 3:22 – The Moment of Awakening: Neville Goddard’s Interpretation</h1>
    <blockquote><p><strong>"And the Lord God said, Truly, the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now he might put out his hand and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever."</strong> — <em>Genesis 3:22 (BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To many, this verse marks the fall of man—a moment of disobedience and divine restriction. But to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, this is no moment of condemnation. Rather, it is a revelation: a declaration of <strong>emergent consciousness</strong>, where man awakens to his <strong>divine potential</strong> through the gift of <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>The Fall as Conscious Expansion</strong></h4>
<p>Traditionally, the story of Adam and Eve is seen as a loss of innocence, a fall into sin. Neville, however, reinterprets this as a <strong>deliberate descent</strong>—not into sinfulness, but into the realm of <strong>experience</strong>. The knowledge of good and evil is the birth of <strong>discernment</strong>. With it, man is no longer a passive being in paradise but an <strong>active creator</strong> capable of shaping reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Man is all imagination,” Neville would affirm, “and God is man, and exists in us and we in Him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this light, Genesis 3:22 is not a warning but a <strong>milestone</strong>. Man has awakened to the divine within—the ability to <strong>know</strong>, to <strong>perceive contrast</strong>, and ultimately, to <strong>create</strong>. This is the first stirrings of Christ within, the divine spark gaining self-awareness.</p>
<h4><strong>“Like One of Us” — Recognising the Divine Image</strong></h4>
<p>The phrase <em>“Truly, the man has become like one of us”</em> does not indicate rivalry or trespass. Instead, it reflects the <strong>inherited nature</strong> of divinity within man. According to Neville, God’s image is not physical, but imaginative. To “become like God” is to awaken to the <strong>creative faculty of thought</strong>—the very power by which worlds are formed.</p>
<p>This verse is evidence of man stepping into his <strong>God-given inheritance</strong>. He is no longer unconscious. He now holds the key to shaping his world through his inner assumptions.</p>
<h4><strong>The Tree of Life — The Inner Way</strong></h4>
<p>The concern in the verse—<em>“he might put out his hand and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever”</em>—is not about divine punishment but <strong>divine timing</strong>. Neville would say that eternal life cannot be granted while man is still <strong>ignorant of his creative nature</strong>. The flaming sword and the guarded way (Genesis 3:24) represent not divine rejection, but the <strong>inner journey of remembrance</strong>.</p>
<p>Only when man awakens to his full creative power can he consciously return to the Tree of Life—<strong>not as a guest, but as a son who knows his Father</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion: Genesis 3:22 as the Beginning, Not the End</strong></h4>
<p>Neville Goddard’s interpretation of Genesis 3:22 transforms it from a tale of restriction into a <strong>prophetic moment of empowerment</strong>. It is the point where man, through the <strong>knowledge of good and evil</strong>, begins his journey back to divine unity—not through obedience, but through <strong>imaginative mastery</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not the fall of man. This is the <strong>rise of consciousness</strong>. A symbolic moment in which man becomes aware that the power to shape life—to eat of the Tree of Life and live forever—lies within him, awaiting his discovery.</p>
