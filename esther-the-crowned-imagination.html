    <h1>Esther the Crowned Imagination</h1>
    <p></p><p>The story of <strong>Esther</strong> is a powerful narrative that reveals profound lessons about the nature of <strong>assumption</strong>, <strong>faith</strong>, and <strong>manifestation</strong>. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Law of Assumption emphasizes the importance of living as though your desires are already fulfilled, embodying the <strong>assumed state</strong> until it becomes your reality. When we apply this principle to the Book of Esther, we can explore how the characters embody different aspects of the <strong>manifestation process</strong>. Let’s delve into how <strong>King Ahasuerus</strong>, <strong>Esther</strong>, <strong>Queen Vashti</strong>, <strong>Mordecai</strong>, and <strong>Haman</strong> symbolise different parts of this journey.</p><h3><strong>The King – The Power of the Imagination</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s framework, the <strong>king</strong> (King Ahasuerus) represents the <strong>creative power</strong> or the <strong>imagination</strong> itself. He is the one who holds the power to make decisions, to influence the course of events, and to grant favours. Just as imagination shapes the external world by impressing the subconscious mind, the king shapes the future through his authority.</p><p>King Ahasuerus calls for a feast, a celebration, a moment of display and decision-making. In the Law of Assumption, this feast represents the <strong>initial assumption</strong>—the assumption of the desired end, the foundation upon which all manifestation begins. Just as Ahasuerus can extend his scepter to grant Esther favour, imagination, when directed by our assumptions, grants us access to the reality we desire.</p><p>The king’s authority mirrors the power of <strong>assumption</strong> in the mind. When we assume a state of being, just like the king, we direct our imagination to create the desired outcome. His scepter can be seen as the <strong>imaginative force</strong> that extends toward us when we align with our desired assumption, granting us access to the manifestations we seek.</p><h3><strong>Esther – The Assumed Identity and Boldness of Action</strong></h3><p><strong>Esther</strong>, the central character, symbolises the <strong>assumed identity</strong> that is necessary for manifestation. She begins as a humble orphan but assumes the identity of <strong>queen</strong> through her <strong>faith</strong> in her transformation. In Neville's terms, she embodies the <strong>assumption of the end</strong>—the belief that she is already the queen, worthy of her position.</p><p>Esther’s journey exemplifies how, by <strong>assuming a state of being</strong> (in her case, a queen), she opens the door for the universe to align circumstances around her. Her courage to approach the king without being summoned is a perfect reflection of how we must <strong>act from the assumed state</strong>, boldly taking steps toward our desires, trusting that the imagination will work in our favour.</p><p>When she approaches King Ahasuerus and says, “<strong>If it pleases the king</strong>,” she embodies the attitude of someone who is already aligned with their desired outcome. This is the moment of <strong>faith in action</strong>, where she steps into the fullness of her assumed identity and demands that the reality match her inner assumption.</p><h3><strong>Queen Vashti – The Resistance to the Old State</strong></h3><p><strong>Queen Vashti</strong> serves as a powerful symbol of the <strong>old state of consciousness</strong>—the <strong>resistance</strong> that prevents us from stepping into our true power. She refuses to appear before the king when summoned, symbolising the <strong>rejection of the old assumptions</strong> or limiting beliefs that no longer serve us. In Neville’s framework, Queen Vashti represents the <strong>old self</strong> that resists the new identity we must take on in order to manifest our desires.</p><p>Vashti’s refusal to submit to the king’s command can be seen as a <strong>symbol of the resistance</strong> to the new assumption. Just as Vashti is deposed and replaced, we must <strong>let go of the old states of consciousness</strong>—the fears, doubts, and limiting beliefs that no longer align with the person we are becoming. The process of <strong>manifestation</strong> often requires us to <strong>cast off old identities</strong> in favour of the new, and Vashti’s removal from the throne represents this shedding of the old self.</p><h3>

</h3><h3><strong>Mordecai – The Inner Guide and Persistent Faith</strong></h3><br /><br />Mordecai, Esther’s cousin and mentor, embodies the role of the inner guide, the persistent faith that keeps us aligned with our assumed identity. He continually reminds Esther of her true purpose and encourages her to act in alignment with her newfound identity as queen. In Neville's terms, Mordecai represents the inner wisdom or higher consciousness that consistently calls us back to our assumed state of being. <br />When Mordecai tells Esther, “Who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” he is affirming her assumed identity and urging her to step boldly into her power. This reminds us that our assumptions have a divine purpose, and by following the guidance of our higher consciousness, we can step into the fullness of our destiny. <br /><br />Mordecai’s steadfast faith in Esther also symbolizes the inner persistence required to manifest our desires. Even when Esther hesitates or doubts, Mordecai’s unwavering belief in her potential reflects how we must trust in our assumed state, even when the external world seems contrary. He teaches us to remain firm in our assumptions and trust that the universe will respond accordingly. <br /><br />Additionally, Mordecai advises Esther to conceal her Jewish identity, telling her not to reveal it to anyone in the king's palace (Esther 2:10). In Neville Goddard’s framework, this can be seen as a symbolic reminder to keep your assumptions and desires concealed within your imagination until they are firmly rooted in your consciousness. Just as Esther hides her true identity until the right moment, we, too, must sometimes keep our desires within, allowing the inner alignment to grow before the external world reflects it.<br /><h4><strong>Mordecai and the Foiling of the Assassination Plot: Listening to the Inner Voice of Wisdom</strong></h4><p>In the unfolding drama, <strong>Mordecai’s</strong> act of overhearing the plot to kill King Ahasuerus is a pivotal moment. It showcases the role of the <strong>inner guide</strong> and the <strong>higher consciousness</strong> that directs us toward the right course of action. According to Neville’s teachings, Mordecai represents the <strong>persistent faith</strong> and <strong>inner wisdom</strong> that we must cultivate when assuming a new state of being.</p><p>Just as Mordecai overhears the assassination plot and alerts Esther, our higher consciousness is constantly attuned to the <strong>inner workings of our minds</strong>—the plots of doubt and resistance that attempt to undermine our assumptions. These "plots" represent the <strong>negative thoughts</strong> and <strong>doubts</strong> that may arise when we are trying to manifest something new. In the same way, Mordecai, as a symbol of our inner guidance, listens to these thoughts, recognises their danger, and redirects them through the <strong>assumption of our desired state</strong>.</p><p>When Mordecai warns Esther and she passes the message along to the king, it is a <strong>symbol of how our higher consciousness</strong> acts as a messenger between our <strong>current state of being</strong> and our <strong>desired state of being</strong>. By communicating our assumptions to our subconscious mind, we invite the universe to align with the end we desire.</p><p>The foiling of the assassination plot mirrors how, when we persist in our assumptions, <strong>external negative forces</strong>—be they doubts, fears, or contradictory circumstances—are neutralised. Just as the king’s life is spared through Mordecai’s intervention, our <strong>assumed state</strong> of positive belief will protect us from the "assassination" of our dreams by doubt and disbelief.</p><h3><strong>Haman – The External Forces of Doubt and Opposition</strong></h3><p><strong>Haman</strong> represents the <strong>external opposition</strong> that often arises when we are assuming a new identity or trying to manifest a new reality. Just as Haman plots against the Jews, our doubts, fears, and external circumstances may seem to conspire against our assumptions. In Neville's terms, Haman symbolises the <strong>thoughts</strong> and <strong>beliefs</strong> that arise from the subconscious mind, attempting to <strong>undermine</strong> our assumed identity.</p><p>However, as in the story, <strong>Haman’s downfall</strong> shows us that these negative forces are not as powerful as the <strong>assumed state</strong> of being. When we <strong>persist in our assumption</strong>, we see that external opposition—like Haman’s plans—is ultimately powerless. The Law of Assumption teaches that once we <strong>persist in our assumptions</strong> and remain true to our imagined end, the <strong>external world</strong> must eventually conform to our internal beliefs.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Law of Assumption in Action</strong></h3><p>The story of Esther serves as a compelling illustration of the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> in action. Each character represents a different aspect of the manifestation process, from the <strong>creative power</strong> of imagination (the king) to the <strong>assumed identity</strong> (Esther) and the <strong>persistent faith</strong> (Mordecai) required to transform external circumstances.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, manifestation is not about waiting for the external world to change; it is about <strong>assuming the state</strong> of the desired end and acting from that place. Just as Esther assumed the identity of queen, we must assume the identity of the person who has already attained our desires. When we align with our assumptions and <strong>stay persistent</strong> in faith, we, too, will see the external world shift to reflect our new state of being.</p><p>Esther’s journey is one of inner transformation, and it demonstrates that, like the king, the universe will respond to the assumptions we hold. The <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> shows us that once we step into the role of the person we wish to be, the world around us must align to make our assumption a reality.</p><p><br /></p>
