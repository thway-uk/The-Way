    <h1>John: Abiding Love</h1>
    <p>In a world brimming with uncertainty, one force stands unshakeable: love. Not merely love as a feeling or fleeting romance, but <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">love</a> as the unifying thread that connects us to the infinite creative power of the universe.</p>
<p>John 15:8 reveals a truth about this connection and its power to bring forth the desires of the heart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this verse, "bearing fruit" symbolises the visible results of our inner assumptions — the external proof that we have fully embraced the state of our wish fulfilled. For Neville Goddard, the "<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Father</a>" represents awareness of being, and to glorify Him is to <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">manifest our desires</a> effortlessly, showing we live from an assumed state rather than striving or doubting.</p>
<h2>The Essence of Abiding: Living in Assumed Love</h2>
<p>To <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">abide in love</a> is to dwell in the unwavering assumption that we are loved, chosen, and one with divine creative power. In John 15:9–10, we are invited into an intimate union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This abiding is not passive waiting; it is the deliberate act of living from the end—the state in which our desires are already fulfilled. As Neville teaches, when we assume the state of the wish fulfilled, we make it real in consciousness first, and then it must be reflected in our outer world.</p><p>'The Father" symbolises the "<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>" — the true, creative self within us. Just as the Father ("I AM") loves and sustains Jesus (the awakened, fully assumed state), so are we invited to abide in that same love. To "abide in my love" is to remain in the awareness that "I AM" is the source of all creation, and to live from the state of already being loved and fulfilled.</p>
<p>This echoes the ancient symbolic union described in Genesis 2:24:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse, often read literally, speaks symbolically to the union of your current self (the conscious mind) with the desired state (the subconscious acceptance). You leave behind the old limitations ("father and mother") and unite with your new assumption ("wife"), becoming one flesh—one new state of being.</p>
<h2>Love as the Source of Manifestation: Bearing the Wish Fulfilled</h2>
<p>When we align with love, we align with the supreme creative force. Love is the sacred soil from which the seeds of our assumptions grow. In this state, we bear fruit—the visible manifestation of our inner convictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full." — John 15:11</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">Joy</a> is the outer expression of your inner union. As you persist in the assumption of love, your world reflects the wishes you have already claimed as true. The fruits of your life—success, harmony, abundance—are the outgrowth of your inner marriage to your desired state.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, imagination is the creative force, and love is the highest vibration of imagination. When you imagine from love, you move beyond mere visualization; you enter into conscious union with your desire. This fusion is the mystical marriage, the "one flesh" of Genesis 2:24, through which your world is reborn.</p>
<h2>Faith and Love: The Divine Bond Through Assumption</h2>
<p>Faith, when joined with love, becomes an unstoppable creative force. John 15:13–14 reminds us of love's power to transform and uplift:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To "lay down one’s life" is to surrender the old self and fully inhabit the new, desired state. In the Law of Assumption, this is the true act of faith: assuming the reality of your wish so fully that you relinquish all doubt.</p>
<p>This faith, grounded in love, ensures that what you assume must manifest. When you embody the belief that you are already whole and worthy, the universe responds by revealing this truth externally.</p>
<h2>Living in Love: The Constant Assumption of Abundance</h2>
<p>Living in love means living in a continuous assumption of abundance. It is not swayed by appearances or external events but remains rooted in the unchanging truth of your union with the divine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world." — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peace is the natural fruit of abiding in love. As you persist in this state, you move beyond reaction and into creation. You are no longer at the mercy of circumstances; instead, you shape them, knowing that your inner assumptions direct all outer events.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: The Fruit of Love and Assumption</h2>
<p>Ultimately, abiding in love is the act of assuming your highest good. As you accept that you are always loved and supported, you invite all that is beautiful and true to blossom in your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have chosen you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last." — John 15:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fruit you bear is nothing less than the embodiment of your inner state. The mystical union of Genesis 2:24—the joining of conscious choice and subconscious acceptance—becomes the creative act that brings your desires into form.</p>
