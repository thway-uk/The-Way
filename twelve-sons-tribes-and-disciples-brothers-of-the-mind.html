    <h1>Twelve Sons, Tribes and Disciples: Brothers of the Mind</h1>
    <p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the <strong>12 sonsa and tribes of Israel</strong> and the <strong>12 disciples of Jesus</strong> are not historical or religious figures. They are symbolic representations of <strong>faculties of the mind</strong> that support and sustain the <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">Law of Assumption</a></strong>—the practice of living and feeling from the fulfilled desire.</p><hr /><h2>The Twelve Sons and Tribes: The Brothers of Your Mind</h2><p>Think of the twelve sons and tribes as the <strong>brothers and groups of your mind</strong>—different aspects, impulses, and faculties within your subconscious and conscious awareness. Each tribe embodies a unique part of your imagination, feelings, beliefs, and desires.</p><p>Just like brothers in a family, these faculties may have different tendencies and sometimes even conflict. But for your desire to manifest, <strong>these brothers must come into harmony and agreement</strong>. United, they create the stable, coherent inner state that sustains your assumption and brings the wished-for reality into experience. The story of <a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">Joseph</a> and his brothers is the good example of this.</p><hr /><h2>The Twelve Disciples:  Supporters of the Assumption</h2><p>In parallel, the twelve disciples symbolise the <strong>conscious faculties and mental attitudes</strong> that align with and support the assumed state—the state in which you live as if your desire is already fulfilled. <a href="/2025/06/the-hatred-of-brothers-imagining.html">The story of Joseph</a> personifies the conscious attempt at assumption and rectifying internal disputes between competing aspects of mind.</p><p>They represent qualities like faith, will, imagination, and understanding, all aligned with the “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>”ness—the self as the creative source.</p><p>These disciples empower your mind to hold the assumption steady, overcoming doubts and distractions, and keeping the brothers (the tribes) united in purpose.</p><hr /><h2>Elohim: The Brotherhood as Judges and Rulers</h2><p>An intriguing insight comes from the Hebrew word <strong>Elohim (אלוהים)</strong>, commonly translated as “<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>.” This word is grammatically plural and can also mean <strong>“judges,” “princes,” or “rulers.”</strong></p><p>This plurality suggests an <strong>inner governance system within the mind</strong>. The tribes and disciples are not just parts but <strong>principles of rulership and judgment</strong>—the brothers and leaders who govern belief, desire, and imagination.</p><p>Understanding the tribes and disciples as named aspects of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> reveals their role as the mind’s inner rulers, maintaining order and directing self perception.</p><p></p><blockquote>“A new command I give you: <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">Love</a> one another. As I have <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">loved</a> you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">love</a> one another.” (John 13:34-35, NIV)</blockquote><p></p><hr /><h2>Harmonising the Mind’s Brotherhood for Manifestation</h2><p>Manifestation requires that all competing aspects work <strong>in alignment and harmony</strong>.</p><p>When the mind’s brothers unite under your new assumption, the wish fulfilled becomes effortless and natural.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Neville Goddard’s symbolic use of the 12 tribes and 12 disciples reveals a profound psychological truth: your mind is made up of many faculties, like brothers, judges, and rulers, each with a role to play in creation.</p><p>By recognising and consciously <strong>uniting these brothers and supporters</strong>, you maintain the state of assumption, activate your imaginative power, and bring your desires into reality.</p>
