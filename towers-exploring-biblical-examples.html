    <h1>Towers: Exploring Biblical Examples</h1>
    <p></p>The Bible is a profound source of psychological symbolism, using vivid images and narratives to express inner states of consciousness and the workings of the mind. Many symbols reoccur throughout Scripture, weaving a coherent story of spiritual and mental transformation.<p>This article explores the rich connections centred on the symbol of the <strong>tower</strong>—an image of strength, protection, identity, and ascent. We examine how the tower appears in <strong>Psalm 144</strong>, the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>, and the story of the <strong>Tower of Babel</strong>, alongside the nourishing imagery of breasts, all illuminated by Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption.</p><hr /><h4>Psalm 144:1–2 — The High Tower Within</h4><p>Psalm 144 opens with a powerful declaration:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Blessed be the Lord my Rock,<br />
Who trains my hands for war,<br />
And my fingers for battle—<br />
My lovingkindness and my fortress,<br />
My high tower and my deliverer,<br />
My shield and the one in whom I take refuge,<br />
Who subdues my people under me.” (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the <strong>“high tower”</strong> symbolises an inner refuge and strength—an <strong>elevated mental fortress</strong>. This tower represents the “I AM” self Neville Goddard describes: the self-aware consciousness that assumes protection, victory, and authority. It is the mental posture from which one prepares to overcome life’s challenges as though engaged in battle.</p><hr /><h4>The Tower as the Elevated “I AM” Perspective</h4><p>Beyond a mere structure, the <strong>tower</strong> is an image of an <strong>elevated place of watchfulness and singular perception</strong>. It is a high vantage point that surveys the wider landscape without distraction or confusion.</p><p>Psychologically, the tower reflects the <strong>“I AM” awareness</strong> elevated above fragmented thoughts and external turmoil. It is the unified, centred viewpoint of self-possession and inner command—the mental place from which the imagination creatively shapes experience.</p><p>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption teaches that “standing in the tower” means mentally embodying the fulfilled desire—living from that elevated self-image and feeling it as real. From this high place of assumption, you are strong, nourished, and victorious; your imagination directs your reality with clarity and confidence.</p><hr /><h4>The Tower of Babel — A Self-Constructed Mountain Reaching Heaven</h4><p>The story of the <strong>Tower of Babel</strong> (Genesis 11:1–9) uses the tower to symbolise the <strong>attempt to build one’s own mountain—a self-constructed ascent towards the heavens</strong>. The people’s desire to make a name for themselves by building a tower “whose top may reach unto heaven” represents an effort to create reality through external works, rather than through inner alignment and assumption.</p><p>Neville’s framework sees this as a symbol of a <strong>false ascent</strong>—building a tower of identity or reality by outward action and effort rather than by the inward assumption of the fulfilled state. The confusion and scattering that follows the tower’s fall illustrate the failure of such attempts that are not grounded in the proper inner “I AM” assumption.</p><hr /><h4>Song of Solomon — Towers of Strength and Nobility</h4><p>In the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>, towers appear as metaphors for the bride’s <strong>strength, beauty, and dignified selfhood</strong>. Her <strong>neck is compared to the Tower of David</strong> (4:4), and she dwells in an <strong>ivory tower</strong> (7:4). These images represent a self-image refined and protected by faithful assumption—an imaginative identity shining with grace and inner power.</p><hr /><h4>The Tower of David — Beloved Strength and the Power of Assumed Identity</h4><p>The <strong>Tower of David</strong> is especially rich in meaning. David means <strong>“beloved”</strong> in Hebrew, a name that evokes the idealised self—the king, the new conscious director of one’s inner world. When the bride’s neck is likened to the Tower of David “built for an armoury, with a thousand shields hanging on it” (Song 4:4), it portrays a self-image that is <strong>both beloved and invincible</strong>.</p><p>This tower is a mental fortress of the assumed “I AM” self, fortified by faith, persistence, and the protective power of imagination. The “shields” are symbolic of the mental armaments that defend this identity against doubt and external challenges.</p><p>The frequent use of the word <strong>“beloved” (Hebrew: dod)</strong> throughout the Song of Solomon emphasises the importance of <strong>cherishing and confidently inhabiting</strong> this state of being. Neville’s teaching shows that it is the feeling of being cherished and secure in the “I AM” that brings about manifestation. The Tower of David thus represents the <strong>stronghold of this beloved and empowered identity</strong> within the imagination.</p><hr /><h4>Song of Solomon 8:10 — Breasts Like Towers: Nourishment and Sustenance</h4><p>When the bride says, <strong>“I am a wall, and my breasts like towers”</strong> (8:10), this imagery extends beyond the physical. Neville’s Law of Assumption invites us to see breasts as symbols of <strong>nourishment and creative sustenance</strong> rather than merely sexual features.</p><p>Biblically, breasts often represent the care given to children—who themselves symbolise new ideas or aspects of the mind. Just as breasts nourish children, these “towers” nourish the <strong>mental children</strong>—the beliefs and states of consciousness that emerge from imagination and need to be nurtured to manifest fully.</p><p>Thus, breasts as towers reflect the <strong>nurturing power of imagination</strong>, sustaining the self-image like a strong wall and high tower, enabling peace and fulfilment to flourish within.</p><hr /><h3>The Tower and Breast Symbolism as the Creative “I AM”</h3><p>Together, these images reveal the inner journey of the imagination under Neville’s Law of Assumption:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>tower</strong> stands as the mental fortress of faith, strength, and creative power—the elevated “I AM” vantage point above distraction and doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>breasts</strong> nourish this fortress, sustaining the feeling of the fulfilled, peaceful self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This assumed state becomes an impregnable stronghold, radiating strength, nurture, and grace.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Bible’s rich symbolism thus invites us to <strong>embody our desired reality fully—feeling secure, nourished, and victorious in the high tower of our own imagination</strong>.</p>
