    <h1>Ephraim and Manasseh</h1>
    <p>According to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, the two sons of <strong>Joseph</strong>—<strong>Ephraim</strong> and <strong>Manasseh</strong>—symbolize different aspects of the <strong>creative process</strong> and the <strong>mental states</strong> involved in manifestation.</p>
<h3><strong>Manasseh</strong>: The Symbol of Forgetting the Past</h3>
<p>Manasseh, whose name means "forgetting," represents the <strong>ability to release and forget past failures, mistakes, or limitations</strong>. Neville teaches that in order to manifest new desires and experiences, one must let go of the past and <strong>focus on the present and future</strong>. Manasseh symbolizes the <strong>mental state of letting go</strong> of old beliefs or past experiences that could hinder the creative process. By forgetting the old, you make space for new possibilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Ephraim</strong>: The Symbol of Fruitfulness and New Beginnings</h3>
<p>Ephraim, whose name means "fruitful," represents <strong>prosperity, growth, and the manifestation of desires</strong>. After letting go of the past (Manasseh), <strong>Ephraim symbolizes the fruit of new creations</strong>—the result of aligning with your desires and believing in their fulfillment. Ephraim embodies <strong>abundance and new beginnings</strong>, symbolizing that when you focus on <strong>positive assumptions</strong> and align with your desired outcomes, you can bring them into reality.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Together, <strong>Ephraim</strong> and <strong>Manasseh</strong> represent the <strong>two crucial steps in manifestation</strong>: the need to <strong>release the old</strong> (Manasseh) in order to <strong>embrace the new and abundant</strong> (Ephraim). To manifest successfully, one must forget past limitations and focus on the <strong>fruitful possibilities</strong> that the imagination and faith can bring into reality.</p>
