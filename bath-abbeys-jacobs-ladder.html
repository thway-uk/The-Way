    <h1>Bath Abbey's 'Jacob's Ladder'</h1>
    <p><a href="Bath Abbey 01225 422462   https://g.co/kgs/mVxtSNv" target="_blank">Bath Abbey</a>, with its stunning carvings of Jacob's Ladder, offers a rich visual narrative that beautifully encapsulates the journey of spiritual awakening. These intricate depictions go beyond mere architectural decoration—they serve as a profound reminder of the connection between the earthly and the divine. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, Jacob's Ladder is not just a biblical story; it is a powerful symbol of personal transformation.</p>
<p>The ladder itself represents the ascent from the dense, subconscious realm of ordinary thought to the expansive heights of spiritual consciousness. Each step on the ladder mirrors our progress as we move beyond the limitations of the physical world and into the realm of imagination—the true creative power. The angels ascending and descending are a vivid representation of the constant flow of ideas and beliefs moving between the conscious and subconscious mind. This dynamic exchange is essential to the process of manifestation, as our thoughts rise from the depths of the subconscious and, through focused imagination, are brought into the tangible reality we experience.</p>
<p>As it is written in Genesis 28:12: <em>"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."</em> This verse beautifully illustrates the bridge between heaven and earth—where our imagination, symbolised by the ladder, connects us to divine creativity.</p>
<p>In this light, Jacob's Ladder becomes a powerful metaphor for spiritual awakening: the higher we climb, the more we align ourselves with the divine creative force, where imagination is the bridge that connects the seen and unseen worlds.</p>
