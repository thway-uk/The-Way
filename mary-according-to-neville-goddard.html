<h1>Mary According to Neville Goddard</h1>
<p><b>The Inner Mary: Neville Goddard's Symbolic View of Biblical Women</b></p><p>According to Neville Goddard's metaphysical interpretation of the Bible, the characters named Mary serve symbolic functions related to the process of conception, belief, and witnessing the divine within the individual. Here's a breakdown of the functions of the key Marys:</p><p><b>Mary, the Virgin Mother: The Receptive Consciousness</b></p><p>Represents the individual's consciousness or awareness in its pure, receptive state. It is the "virgin" aspect that conceives without the aid of man, symbolizing that our desires are self-conceived through our imagination. The "angel" announcing the birth of Jesus symbolizes the method or the feeling that impregnates this receptive consciousness with the desired state (the "son"). Mary's acceptance ("How shall this be?") and subsequent quiet confidence represent the necessary receptive attitude of mind to allow the desired state to take root and manifest.</p><p><b>Mary Magdalene: Unconditional Love and Devotion</b></p><p>Often represents unconditional love and devotion towards the awakened consciousness (Jesus). She is typically depicted as one of the first to witness the risen Christ, symbolizing the deep emotional connection and unwavering faith that recognizes the divine within. In some interpretations, she also embodies a deeper, more intuitive understanding of Jesus' teachings beyond the intellectual level.</p><p><b>Mary of Bethany: Contemplation and Intuition</b></p><p>Represents the contemplative and intuitive aspect of consciousness that prioritizes the inner experience of being in the presence of the divine (Jesus). Her act of sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to his words symbolizes the importance of inner reflection and absorption of spiritual truths.</p><p><b>The Essence of the Marys: Facets of Our Inner Self</b></p><p>In essence, the various characters named Mary in the Bible, according to Neville, are not literal historical figures but rather personifications of different facets of the individual's own consciousness and their relationship to the awakening divine within. They illustrate the process of conceiving desires, holding unwavering belief, experiencing the divine through love and intuition, and prioritizing inner knowing.</p><p><br /></p>
