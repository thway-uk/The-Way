<h1>Advanced Mastery of Manifestation — Part I: No Condemnation in the Fulfilled Assumption</h1>
<p><strong>“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus” — Romans 8:1 NIV</strong></p>
<h3>🔹 Psychological Key:</h3>
<p>This verse, when viewed through the framework of manifestation, is a profound declaration of identity. Neville Goddard taught that <em>“Christ”</em> represents your own wonderful human imagination—your ability to assume a new state of being. To be <em>“in Christ Jesus”</em> is to be in the consciousness of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>To <em>“walk not after the flesh”</em> means to cease identifying with what your senses report—your present, outer world. To <em>“walk after the Spirit”</em> is to live in alignment with your inner assumption, regardless of appearances.</p>
<h3>🔹 Manifestation Principle:</h3>
<p><strong>Condemnation only exists in self-doubt.</strong> When you truly abide in your assumption—fully embodying the state of the fulfilled desire—there is no internal judgment, guilt, or oscillation. Condemnation is the inner critic that belongs to the old state of consciousness, the one trying to drag you back to “reality.” But when you persist in the new identity, the former law of cause-and-effect (living by outer facts) is replaced by spiritual causation: <strong>Imagination becomes the source.</strong></p>
<h3>🔹 Application:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>To be “in Christ” is to feel from the state of already having.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the assumption is <em>natural</em>, there is no self-condemnation because you're no longer attempting to <em>get</em>—you <em>are</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This verse is not moralistic; it’s functional. “No condemnation” is the absence of duality between your assumption and your behaviour.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>🔹 Advanced Manifestation Tip:</h3>
<p>When you find yourself questioning, doubting, or "checking" whether it’s working, remind yourself:<br />
<strong>“There is therefore now no condemnation.”</strong><br />
Return to the Spirit—that inner knowing. The moment you shift back into <em>feeling from</em>, you walk again after the Spirit, not the flesh.</p>
