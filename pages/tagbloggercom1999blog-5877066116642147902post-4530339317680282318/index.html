<div>"I AM" so glad I found Neville Goddard books which have led me here for more understanding of the Law. Everything is making so much sense to me now. Although breaking the outer chains is very hard to do but I am trying very hard, perhaps too hard. I read the books and the Bible daily and now your explanations of passages. "I AM" thanking you deeply.</div>
