    <h1>Psalm 24: The Earth is the Lord's</h1>
    <blockquote><p><strong>The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it,</strong><br />
<strong>the world, and all who live in it;</strong><br />
<strong>for he founded it upon the seas</strong><br />
<strong>and established it upon the waters.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:1–2)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is an ode to imagination itself. The world around us is a reflection of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>, the outer manifestation of the inner creative power that forms our reality. It springs from the deep “waters” of the imaginative mind—just as Genesis 1:11 describes the principle that every seed contains its own tree. This is the <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">seed of imagination within us, unfolding in the visible world.</a></p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?</strong><br />
<strong>Who may stand in his holy place?</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:3)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the journey toward higher consciousness—the ascent to imaginal elevation. The “mountain” symbolises an elevated use of imagination, where the divine dwells and where we align with our truest creative potential.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,</strong><br />
<strong>who does not trust in an idol</strong><br />
<strong>or swear by a false god.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:4)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To reach this place, we must free ourselves from limiting beliefs, self-doubt, and external distractions. “Clean hands and a pure heart” symbolise mental clarity and an undivided mind, committed to truth rather than illusion.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>They will receive blessing from the Lord</strong><br />
<strong>and vindication from God their Saviour.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:5)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When we cleanse our inner world and align with the creative power of imagination, we experience the flow of divine blessing—clarity, direction, and the manifestation of our true desires.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Such is the generation of those who seek him,</strong><br />
<strong>who seek your face, God of Jacob.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:6)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This “generation” is symbolic of a consciousness that actively seeks the divine within. It is not about lineage or time but about awakening: those who truly seek to understand and live from their inner creative power.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Lift up your heads, you gates;</strong><br />
<strong>be lifted up, you ancient doors,</strong><br />
<strong>that the King of glory may come in.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:7)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “gates” and “doors” are the openings of the subconscious mind. To lift them is to raise our awareness and allow the divine imagination to enter and govern.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Who is this King of glory?</strong><br />
<strong>The Lord strong and mighty,</strong><br />
<strong>the Lord mighty in battle.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:8)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “King of glory” is the powerful, imaginative force within us. It is “mighty in battle” because it overcomes resistance, doubt, and fear, conquering the internal enemies of limitation.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Lift up your heads, you gates;</strong><br />
<strong>lift them up, you ancient doors,</strong><br />
<strong>that the King of glory may come in.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:9)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Again, the call to elevate consciousness and open the inner self is repeated. Transformation happens when we allow the divine imagination to reign.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Who is he, this King of glory?</strong><br />
<strong>The Lord Almighty—</strong><br />
<strong>he is the King of glory.</strong><br />
<em>(Psalm 24:10)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “King of glory” is the awakened creative power of imagination—God within us. When fully recognised and embraced, this becomes the ruling force of our lives.</p><hr /><p>




















</p><p><strong>In Summary:</strong><br />
In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, Psalm 24 is a symbolic map of spiritual awakening. It speaks of cleansing the mind, raising our inner state, and recognising imagination as the foundational force—the “King of glory.” It is the call to ascend in awareness and unlock the blessings that follow when we live from the seed planted in the depths of consciousness.</p>
