<h1>Jesus: Writing on the Ground</h1>
<p>The story of the woman caught in adultery, found in the Gospel of John (John 8:1–11), is a poignant and compassionate moment in the New Testament. It depicts a <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> brought before <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>, accused by the scribes and Pharisees, and facing death by stoning under the law. Instead of condemning her, Jesus responds with grace and silence—bending down to write on the ground, then famously declaring, <em>“Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.”</em></p>
<p>For Neville, the Bible is not a historical record, but <strong>a psychological drama playing out within the individual</strong>. Each character, action, and setting symbolises aspects of the <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">human mind</a>, particularly the interplay between the <strong>conscious and subconscious</strong>, <strong>imagination</strong>, and <strong>belief</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Woman as the Mirroring Mind</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville’s symbolic system, the woman caught in adultery represents <strong>the receptive womb of the mind</strong>, which has been momentarily united with a false belief or undesirable mental state. Adultery, then, is not a physical sin, but the <strong><a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">misalignment of consciousness</a></strong>—being <a href="/2025/04/genesis-417-26-escalation-of-violence.html">mentally “joined” to fear, guilt, limitation</a>, or any idea that contradicts your desired reality.</p>
<p>The scribes and Pharisees, as accusers, symbolise the <strong>judging intellect</strong>—those inner voices of self-condemnation, rigidity, and moral superiority. They operate according to the law (cause and effect, karma, guilt), without grace.</p>
<p>Jesus represents <strong>the awakened Imagination</strong>, or <strong>Christ within</strong>—that part of us that does not condemn, but transforms.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Writing on the Ground – A Metaphor for Impressing the Subconscious</strong></h3>
<p>One  curious moment in the story is when Jesus stoops down and writes on the ground. The Bible does not tell us what he wrote, which opens the door to deeper symbolic interpretation.</p>
<p>According to Neville, <strong>the ground often symbolises the subconscious mind</strong>—the fertile soil into which seeds of belief are sown. Jesus writing on the ground can therefore be understood as the <strong>Imagination impressing a new idea or judgment</strong> upon the subconscious, replacing condemnation with forgiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment of silence—Jesus writing, not speaking—is meaningful. Neville often taught the value of <strong>inner stillness</strong>, the deliberate use of imagination in quiet confidence. Jesus is not reacting to the accusers; he is <strong>rewriting the narrative</strong> from within.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>"Neither Do I Condemn Thee" – The Law of Revision</strong></h3>
<p>After the accusers depart, Jesus says, <em>“Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">sin</a> no more.”</em> In Neville’s teaching, this is a perfect example of the <strong>Law of Revision</strong>—the act of <strong>mentally rewriting the past or present to align with a <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new, desired state</a></strong>.</p>
<p>To forgive, according to Neville, is to forget the former state entirely and accept a new one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Forgiveness is the ability to put oneself into another state altogether and not continue to identify the present self with the former state.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman is no longer defined by her past (her previous state of consciousness). She is now free—free to embody a new identity, unshackled by guilt or shame.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Summary: The Inner Meaning of the Story</strong></h3>
<p>Seen through Neville Goddard’s lens, the story of the woman caught in adultery becomes a profound psychological teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The woman</strong> = the subconscious mind, temporarily aligned with a limiting or false belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The accusers</strong> = judgemental thoughts, inner critics, and inherited ideas of guilt and punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong> = the creative Imagination, which neither judges nor condemns but transforms through grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing on the ground</strong> = the deliberate impressing of new truth upon the subconscious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The outcome</strong> = freedom, through revision and inner acceptance of a new state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Grace Over Law</strong></h3>
<p>In this story, Jesus does not reject the law—he transcends it. Neville would say that this reflects a higher law: <strong>the law of consciousness</strong>. What you accept as true within will manifest without. But condemnation keeps you bound to old states; only <strong>imaginative forgiveness and revision</strong> can set you free.</p>
<p>The act of writing on the ground is not just an act of silence—it is the <strong>creative moment where your inner world is rewritten</strong>. Once the subconscious has been impressed with a new truth, the old state dissolves, and a new life begins.</p>
<p>This is not just the story of a woman—it is <strong>the story of us all</strong>.</p>
