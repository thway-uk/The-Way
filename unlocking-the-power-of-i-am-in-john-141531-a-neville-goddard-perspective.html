<h1>Unlocking the Power of "I AM" in John 14:15–31: A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1>
<p>John 14:15–31 contains a deep conversation between Jesus and His disciples, filled with promise, comfort, and guidance. Through Neville Goddard's teachings, we can interpret this passage not just as a historical account, but as a profound exploration of the creative power of imagination and the <strong>I AM</strong> consciousness. By applying Neville's principles, these verses become a roadmap for how to unlock the power within us to manifest our desires. Let's explore each verse from this perspective.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:15</strong></h3><p>“If you love me, keep my commandments.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
To <strong>love</strong> Jesus is to fully embrace the creative power of <strong>I AM</strong> within you. Neville Goddard teaches that imagination is the creative force of the universe, and by keeping His commandments, you align yourself with this power. The “commandments” are not external rules but internal laws of manifestation—primarily, the law of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:16</strong></h3><p>“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The Comforter is the <strong>I AM</strong> within you—your imagination. The Father (your higher consciousness) sends the Comforter to dwell within you forever. Imagination, when fully embraced, becomes your guide and teacher, available at all times to help you manifest the desires of your heart.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:17</strong></h3><p>“Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The Spirit of truth is the divine presence of <strong>I AM</strong> within you. The outer world cannot perceive this truth because it is not external—it is internal, existing in your imagination. When you awaken to the power of imagination, you realise that this Spirit is with you, teaching you to create your own reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:18</strong></h3><p>“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
Jesus assures His disciples that they will never be left without comfort. In Neville's framework, this means that your imagination is always available to you. When you face challenges or uncertainties, you can turn within and use the power of <strong>I AM</strong> to comfort and guide you through the creative process.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:19</strong></h3><p>“Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The world cannot perceive the creative power of imagination, but those who awaken to the <strong>I AM</strong> consciousness can. This verse emphasises that as imagination (the <strong>I AM</strong>) lives, so too will you live—your desires come into being through your imagination, and this is the life force that sustains you.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:20</strong></h3><p>“At that day you shall know that <i><b>I am</b></i> in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
This moment of realisation signifies the union between <strong>I AM</strong> (your imagination), the Father (divine consciousness), and you. When you align with your imagination, you understand that there is no separation between your creative power and the divine. You live as one with the source of all creation.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:21</strong></h3><p>“He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
To “have and keep” Jesus' commandments means living by the law of imagination. This is not a passive action but a conscious, active choice to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. By doing so, the Father (divine consciousness) and Jesus (the creative power within you) manifest in your life, making your desires a reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:22</strong></h3><p>“Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself unto us, and not unto the world?”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The world cannot perceive the power of imagination because it relies on external, material evidence. But those who have awakened to their inner power can perceive the workings of <strong>I AM</strong>. It is through imagination that you see the world differently, as you live in the state of the wish fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:23</strong></h3><p>“Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
Loving Jesus is the same as living in alignment with your imagination—your <strong>I AM</strong>. When you keep His words (the law of creation through imagination), you invite the Father (divine consciousness) and the Son (your imagination) to dwell within you. They make their abode within you, guiding you to manifest your desires.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:24</strong></h3><p>“He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
Those who do not embrace the power of imagination miss the point of creation. The word that you hear is not just an external command, but an internal truth. The word of God (divine consciousness) is the creative force of imagination. By aligning with it, you begin to create your world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:25</strong></h3><p>“These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
Jesus speaks not of a distant past but of a present reality—the power of imagination is always within you. The creative process is not a future event; it is here and now. Your <strong>I AM</strong> consciousness is always available to guide your manifestation.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:26</strong></h3><p>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The Comforter is your imagination—the power of <strong>I AM</strong> that teaches you the truths of creation. When you remember your ability to create through imagination, you are reminded of the divine law of manifestation, which is always available to you.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:27</strong></h3><p>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The peace of <strong>I AM</strong> is the peace of knowing that you are the creator of your reality. Unlike the temporary peace of the world, this peace is lasting because it comes from the certainty that your desires are already fulfilled through your imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:28</strong></h3><p>“Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
When you realise the power of imagination, you understand that <strong>I AM</strong> is not separate from the Father (divine consciousness). The return to the Father signifies the return to a state of pure consciousness and creative power. This is a joyous awakening to your true potential.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:29</strong></h3><p>“And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might believe.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The act of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled is to see the end result before it materialises. By imagining and believing it already to be true, you bring it into existence. This is the law of creation in action.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:30</strong></h3><p>“Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
The "prince of this world" represents the distractions and material forces that try to pull you away from your inner power. When you fully align with <strong>I AM</strong>, the external world has no control over you. You are free to create your own reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 14:31</strong></h3><p>“But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.”</p><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>:<br />
By living in alignment with your imagination (<strong>I AM</strong>), you express your love for the Father (divine consciousness). This is not about passive belief but active creation. As you rise and follow the divine command of imagination, you bring your desires into your world.</p><hr /><p>






































































</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />

These verses guide us in understanding the power of imagination, teaching us how to manifest our desires and live in alignment with our divine consciousness. By embracing the <strong>I AM</strong> within, we can bring into existence whatever we assume to be true, unlocking the full potential of our creative power.</p>
