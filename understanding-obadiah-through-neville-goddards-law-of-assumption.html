    <h1>Understanding Obadiah Through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</h1>
    <p></p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, you manifest by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Obadiah, though only one chapter, vividly depicts the fall of false beliefs (Edom) and the rise of true inner power (Israel). Read each verse below and see how it applies to shifting your assumptions and creating your reality.<hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:1</h4><blockquote>
<p>“The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord has said about Edom: We have had word from the Lord, and a representative has been sent among the nations, saying, Up! and let us make war against her.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
The “vision” signifies an awakening of awareness. In Neville’s terms, the “battle” is internal: a fight against limiting self-beliefs (Edom). To “rise up” means to wake up to your creative imagination and assume the state you desire, rather than remain under old, limiting assumptions.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:2</h4><blockquote>
<p>“See, I have made you small among the nations: you are much looked down on.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Feeling “small” and “looked down on” represents the false self-image created by assuming lack or unworthiness. Neville teaches that this diminishes your power. To manifest, you must replace smallness with the assumption of greatness and worthiness, thereby expanding your consciousness.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:3</h4><blockquote>
<p>“You have been tricked by the pride of your heart, O you whose living-place is in the cracks of the rock, whose house is high up; who has said in his heart, Who will make me come down to earth?”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
“Pride” here is the ego’s false sense of invulnerability. The “cracks of the rock” are external props you lean on for security. Neville shows that true security comes from within—by assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled. No external circumstance can “bring you down” when your inner assumption is fixed.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:4</h4><blockquote>
<p>“Though you lift yourself up as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down, says the Lord.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
The “eagle” and its “nest among the stars” are inflated self-images based on external validation. Neville warns that any assumption not rooted in your inner creative power is unstable and must collapse. Only by assuming your true, fulfilled state can you remain truly elevated.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:5</h4><blockquote>
<p>“If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, how were you cut off! Would they not have stolen until they had enough? Would grape gatherers not leave some grapes?”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
“Thieves” and “robbers” are limiting thoughts and doubts that “steal” your peace when you assume lack. Neville’s remedy is to assume abundance so fully that there is “nothing left” for doubt to take—your consciousness remains filled with the feeling of fullness.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:6</h4><blockquote>
<p>“How have the things of Esau been searched out! how have his hidden things been sought up!”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
“Esau” stands for the outer, material world; its “hidden things” are your subconscious beliefs. Neville teaches that to change the outer, you must first excavate and transform those hidden assumptions. What you uncover and revise in your inner world then reshapes your experience.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:7</h4><blockquote>
<p>“All the men of your confederacy have brought you to the border: the men at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you; they who ate your bread have laid a wound under you: there is no understanding in him.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Your “confederacy” is the network of false beliefs you align with—thoughts that masquerade as support but actually limit you. Neville shows that true support comes from the assumption of your fulfilled desire; any belief that contradicts it must be cut off, or it will wound your manifestation.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:8</h4><blockquote>
<p>“On that day, says the Lord, I will destroy wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Here “wise men” are worldly, fear-based assumptions masquerading as truth. Neville teaches that to manifest, you must “destroy” these limiting beliefs—let go of old “understanding” rooted in doubt—and adopt the true wisdom that imagination is your only creative power.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:9</h4><blockquote>
<p>“Your mighty men, O Teman, shall be afraid, so that everyone from the mount of Esau will be cut off by slaughter.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
“Mighty men” symbolize the ego’s false strengths built on fear and limitation. Neville’s Law of Assumption “slaughters” these when you assume your desired state so fully that the old beliefs collapse, leaving only the assumption aligned with your fulfilled wish.</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:10</h4><blockquote>
<p>“Because of your violence against your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off for ever.”</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
“Violence against your brother Jacob” (imagination) is the self-sabotage of denying your own creative power. The resulting “shame” is the feeling of separation. Neville shows that when you honour your imagination—by assuming your desire fulfilled—shame vanishes and you are never “cut off.”</p><hr /><h4>Obadiah 1:11–21 (Summary)</h4><p>From verse 11 onward, Edom’s ultimate destruction and Israel’s restoration unfold. In Neville’s view, Edom is the old self (limiting assumptions) that must perish, and Israel is the new self (assumption fulfilled) that rises victorious. Manifestation occurs when you steadfastly assume the state of your wish fulfilled, allowing all old beliefs to fall away.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Obadiah’s drama between Edom and Israel mirrors your inner journey from limiting beliefs to the assumption of your wishes fulfilled. By examining each verse and applying Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, you see that <strong>every</strong> shift in assumption—away from fear, pride, and lack and into the feeling of the wish fulfilled—transforms your reality from the inside out.</p>
