<h1>Peter: I Do Not Know the Man</h1>
<p>In John 18, we find a powerful moment of tension. Jesus is arrested. The air is thick with confusion and fear. And standing just outside the threshold is Peter—waiting, watching, and slowly beginning to deny the very one he once followed with unshakable loyalty.</p>
<p>But beside this emotional unraveling is another character: an unnamed disciple who goes with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. No explanation is given. No words are spoken. He simply enters.</p>
<p>When read symbolically, through the insight offered by Neville Goddard, this scene becomes more than historical detail. It becomes a psychological parable about what happens when the old structure of belief cannot keep up with the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new assumption</a></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Peter and the Problem of Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>Peter—whose name means <em>rock</em>—symbolises the externalised faith you build your identity on. He represents the <strong>named assumption</strong>, the state of belief you consciously cling to. It’s loyal, passionate, and committed to the spiritual life—until change comes.</p>
<p>When Jesus is arrested and begins the journey toward crucifixion, He is <strong>moving inward</strong>, embodying a new state of consciousness. In Neville’s terms, this is the moment where <strong>the inner I AM</strong> fully assumes a new reality and prepares to impress that truth upon the subconscious mind—symbolised by the cross.</p>
<p>Peter, unable to understand this shift, is left outside. And when confronted about knowing Jesus, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I do not <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">know the man</a>.”<br />
—Matthew 26:72</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter’s denial is not just fear—it is a <strong>psychological inability to recognise the I AM</strong> once it has assumed a new state. Peter knew Jesus in His former identity. But the consciousness he once followed has moved beyond his understanding. Jesus is no longer ‘knowable’ to him in the old form.</p>
<p>This is the exact experience we face when we dare to assume a new self-concept. Our old beliefs—our Peters—cannot see us as we now are. The outer self cannot keep pace with the inner transformation. The denial is not betrayal—it’s the disconnect between the <strong>new inner claim</strong> and the <strong>old outer perception</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Unnamed Disciple: Silent Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>In contrast to Peter stands the unnamed disciple. He is already inside. Known to the high priest. Present with Jesus.</p>
<p>Why is he unnamed?</p>
<p>Neville taught that names in scripture represent fixed qualities or defined states of mind. To be unnamed is to represent something <strong>unconditioned</strong>, silent, and closer to truth. The unnamed disciple symbolises <strong>the part of you that already knows</strong>, intuitively, inwardly—without needing confirmation or proof.</p>
<p>He does not stand outside questioning. He does not flinch or speak. He simply <strong>moves with the I AM</strong> into its next phase. This disciple symbolises the aspect of you that already recognises your transformation. It does not need the outer appearance to make sense—it dwells quietly in the awareness of your new state.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>A Spiritual Tension: Inner Movement, Outer Lag</strong></h2>
<p>Together, these two disciples show the division that occurs within whenever you shift your state of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> is your existing belief structure—your known self-image, which cannot yet see the truth of the new state and therefore <em>denies</em> it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The unnamed disciple</strong> is the silent, inner awareness—already in alignment with the transformation that has begun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This drama plays out in every person who attempts to live from a new assumption. You feel the pull of the old belief saying, <em>“I do not know this version of you”</em>, while something deeper within walks confidently into the temple of a new identity.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Crowing of the Cock: The Moment of Awakening</strong></h2>
<p>Peter’s denial is marked by a prophetic sound—the cock crows. Neville saw this as symbolic of <strong>awakening</strong>, the dawning realisation that outer belief has failed to keep pace with inner truth. It is the moment you confront the tension in yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I said I believed—but clearly I did not fully recognise the new state.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not failure. It is simply the surfacing of the split between your conditioned beliefs and your emerging self. The cock crowing signals the call to integrate the two—so that faith may be reborn from within, no longer dependent on form, but grounded in inner conviction.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Conclusion: From Denial to Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>The story of Peter and the unnamed disciple is not about two men in history—it is about you.</p>
<p>It is about the <strong>faith that follows</strong>, the <strong>faith that flinches</strong>, and the <strong>silent awareness that knows</strong>.</p>
<p>Every time you assume a new reality in imagination, part of you may resist it. That’s Peter, standing outside. But there is always a deeper part of you—the unnamed, the intuitive—that walks straight in.</p>
<p>Let the outer denials be a sign, not of failure, but of movement. And when the cock crows—when awakening comes—you’ll realise the truth was always recognised by the part of you that never needed to ask.</p>
