    <h1>Rachel and Laban: Shedding Old Assumptions</h1>
    <p>In <strong>Genesis 31</strong>, one of the most intriguing and symbolically rich moments in the Bible unfolds: <strong>Rachel flees with her father Laban’s household idols (teraphim)</strong>, secretly hiding them beneath her as she escapes. What could this mean — especially when viewed through the Law of Assumption and Neville Goddard’s teaching on the creative power of <strong>“I AM”</strong>?</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Rachel: The Beloved State in Flight</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">Rachel</a> represents the <strong><a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">ideal self</a></strong>, the inner desire, the new consciousness yearning to be fully assumed. But her journey is not without conflict.</p>
<p>She flees from <a href="/2025/05/leaving-old-state-behind-genesis-224.html"><strong>Laban</strong>, who symbolises the <strong>old thought system</strong>, the </a><strong><a href="/2025/05/leaving-old-state-behind-genesis-224.html">entrenched assumption</a>s</strong> that governed her life — beliefs inherited, rigid, and no longer aligned with the new reality she is moving toward.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Teraphim: Old Assumptions Hidden but Carried</strong></h2>
<p>The household gods, or <strong>teraphim</strong>, are the <strong>embodiment of Laban’s old assumptions</strong> — the mental and emotional frameworks Rachel must leave behind to step fully into her new “I AM.”</p>
<p>Rather than abandoning them outright, Rachel <strong>hides them beneath her</strong>, carrying them secretly as she flees. This shows how even in our spiritual or mental progress, we sometimes carry <strong>old beliefs hidden deep within</strong>, often without full awareness.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Menstruation: Shedding the Old Cycle</strong></h2>
<p>When Laban searches for the idols, Rachel tells him she cannot get up because <strong>“the manner of women is upon me”</strong> — a reference to menstruation.</p>
<p>Symbolically, this menstruation represents a <strong>shedding process</strong> — a <strong>letting go of old cycles</strong>, old limitations, and mental patterns. Menstruation in ancient symbolism often signifies <strong>cleansing and renewal</strong>, the breaking of a cycle that no longer serves.</p>
<p>Rachel is <strong>literally and figuratively in a state of transition</strong> — she cannot “rise” into her new state fully yet because she is still <strong>in the process of releasing the old</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Law of Assumption & ‘I AM’: The Moment of Transformation</strong></h2>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that our <strong>consciousness shapes reality</strong>, and that we must <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong> to manifest it.</p>
<p>Rachel’s flight with the teraphim is a vivid picture of the <strong>Law of Assumption in action</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She <strong>rejects Laban’s old assumptions</strong> by leaving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet she <strong>secretly carries them</strong>, showing the subconscious tendency to cling to old beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The menstruation reveals that she is <strong>in the process of cleansing</strong> these beliefs — a painful but necessary passage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her inability to “rise” yet shows that <strong>full assumption has not yet occurred</strong>; she is mid-transformation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The message is clear: <strong>To fully assume your new “I AM,” you must consciously shed and release old thought patterns.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>What Happens Next? The Old Mindset is Defeated</strong></h2>
<p>Laban searches but <strong>does not find the idols</strong>. The old system cannot hold onto what is truly leaving. Rachel’s flight is successful because the <strong>new consciousness cannot be arrested by the old</strong>.</p>
