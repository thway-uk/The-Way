    <h1>Caught Up to the Third Heaven: The Climax of Spiritual Awakening</h1>
    <p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“…such a man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows—was taken up into the third heaven.”</strong></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>
<em>(2 Corinthians 12:2, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, the <strong>“third heaven”</strong> is not a physical location but a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>—the peak of the spiritual ascent, where the self is fully unified with the divine awareness of "I AM".</p>
<p>Just as the Hebrew temple had <strong>three chambers</strong>—the outer court, the holy place, and the <strong>holy of holies</strong>—this “third” realm symbolises the deepest interior state, where man meets God <strong>within</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Symbolic Levels of Heaven</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>First Heaven</strong> – The world of appearances: assumption is still externalised, dependent on the five senses. One is ruled by facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second Heaven</strong> – The world of belief: the imaginal act is known but wavers. Here, one battles inner doubts, like Jacob wrestling the angel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third Heaven</strong> – The state of <strong>full identification with the I AM</strong>. No more separation between self and assumption. It is <em>done</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This “being caught up” is the moment Neville refers to when <strong>consciousness is raised</strong>, and the assumed identity is <strong>fully fused with the divine name</strong>—I AM THAT I AM.</p>
<h3><strong>In Neville’s Terms: The Birth of the New Man</strong></h3>
<p>Being taken to the third heaven is the <strong>spiritual birth</strong> Neville often speaks of, where the awareness of being becomes fixed in its new identity. This is not a dream or vision, but a <strong>felt shift</strong>, a mystical knowing that bypasses the rational mind.</p>
<p>In this “heaven,” the imaginal act has <strong>no gap</strong> between inner assumption and outer fact. It is the <strong>fulfilment</strong> of the law: “When you pray, believe you have received it, and you will.”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>In summary:</strong><br />
The “third heaven” represents the <strong>state of consciousness where imagining and being are one</strong>. It is the seat of creation, the inner Holy of Holies, where God reveals Himself not as other, but as <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>.</p>
