    <title>Paul: One Body with Many Members</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Paul: One Body with Many Members</h1>
    <p>When Paul speaks of the Church as <strong>“<a href="/p/elohim-god.html">one body with many members</a>,”</strong> in 1 Corinthians 12:12-31, he is not describing Christian community. He is revealing a mystical pattern: that <strong>the Divine expresses itself through differentiated function</strong>, united by a single animating Spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.”<br />
— 1 Corinthians 12:12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the opening lines of Genesis, <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a> is introduced not as a singular person but as <strong>Elohim</strong>—a plural name describing <strong>many powers acting as one</strong>. The revelation of the “body of Christ” is not a new structure—it is the <strong>unfolding of Elohim in conscious human form</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Elohim: Unity Through Divine Multiplicity</strong></h3>
<p>The name <strong><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">Elohim</a></strong> appears in Genesis 1:1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though often translated simply as <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">“God,” <em>Elohim</em></a> is a <strong>plural noun</strong> paired with <strong>singular verbs</strong>—a deliberate tension in the Hebrew that points to a divine mystery: <strong>oneness expressed through many facets</strong>.</p>
<p>Elohim is not a cluster of deities but a <strong>composite power</strong>—a single creative force comprised of <strong>multiple expressions</strong>. Neville Goddard often equated Elohim with the creative faculties of the human imagination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Elohim is a compound unity, one made up of others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mirrors Paul’s teaching: we are not separate, isolated individuals—we are <strong>aspects of the One Creative Being</strong>, differentiated in function but unified in essence.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Paul’s Revelation: The Body of Christ as Divine Structure</strong></h3>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12, Paul maps out a <strong>spiritual anatomy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The body has many parts—hands, eyes, ears, feet—but one life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each member is <strong>placed by God</strong> (v.18) and <strong>needed by the others</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No part can be discarded without wounding the whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not metaphor only—it is <strong>the pattern of divine function</strong>, revealed in form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are the body of <a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Christ</a>, and each one of you is a part of it.”<br />
— 1 Corinthians 12:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Paul is not inventing a new theology; he is <strong>unveiling the meaning of Elohim in human terms</strong>. The body is the structure through which the <strong>divine powers act in union</strong>—a visible expression of what Genesis declared invisibly.</p><p></p><blockquote>"But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html"><b>pleasing</b></a> to him." — 1 Corinthians 12:18</blockquote><p></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Function Over Hierarchy: The Divine Equality of Powers</strong></h3>
<p>Paul is careful to warn against <strong>spiritual elitism</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I don’t need you.’” (v.21)<br />
“Those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.” (v.22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This affirms the Elohim principle: <strong>each power has its place</strong>, and the seeming lowliness of one function does not negate its worth.</p>
<p>In the framework of Neville’s teaching, we might say:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The imagination that dreams,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feeling that accepts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The act that sustains belief—<br />
These are all <strong>members of the body</strong> of creation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no “lesser” faculty when <strong>all are divine powers</strong> operating in harmony.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Body as Image and Instrument</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">make man in our image</a>…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul’s teaching completes this: the image is not a static form—it is a <strong>living, dynamic body</strong>, an <strong>organised structure of divine powers</strong> moving in unity. The “image” becomes a <strong>functioning body</strong>, not just a likeness, but an <strong>instrument</strong> of creation.</p>
<p>To say “we are members of one body” is to confess that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No power is outside the whole</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No function stands alone</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the <strong>whole structure reveals God</strong>—the Elohim—moving through us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Elohim Revealed Through the One Body</strong></h3>
<p>Paul’s vision of the body is more than church unity—it is the <strong>inner architecture of creation itself</strong>. Each believer, each function of the imagination, is a <strong>member</strong>—not an ornament, but a power. Together, they form the <strong>body of the Christ</strong>, the visible revelation of <strong>Elohim in action</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is one body and one Spirit… one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.”<br />
— Ephesians 4:4–6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the mystery: not that God is far off, but that <strong>Elohim is revealed in the body of man</strong>—when every faculty of being moves in harmony with divine intent.</p>
