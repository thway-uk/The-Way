    <h1>The Bible Repeatedly Teaches That “I AM” Saves</h1>
    <p>Many believe the Bible is about an external God far above, but when read with spiritual insight, it reveals a profound inner truth: <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"><strong>I AM</strong> — your own consciousness</a> — is the saviour.</p>
<p>The Bible boldly declares this throughout. It’s not hidden — it’s everywhere, from the Old Testament to the words of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> himself.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Old Testament “I AM” Declarations</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM WHO I AM</strong> (Exodus 3:14)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And he said, 'Say this to the people of Israel: I AM has sent me to you.'"<br />
This is the foundational revelation of God’s name: pure awareness, unconditioned being.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>

<p><strong>I AM He who blots out your transgressions</strong> (Isaiah 43:25)</p>
</li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be still, and know that I AM God</strong> (Psalm 46:10)</p>

<h3><strong>Jesus’ “I AM” Statements in the New Testament</strong></h3>
<p>In the Gospel of John especially, Jesus makes powerful “I AM” statements — each revealing the divine presence within you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the bread of life</strong> (John 6:35)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the light of the world</strong> (John 8:12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Before Abraham was, I AM</strong> (John 8:58) — here, he directly uses the divine name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the door</strong> (John 10:9)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the good shepherd</strong> (John 10:11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the resurrection and the life</strong> (John 11:25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the way, the truth, and the life</strong> (John 14:6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the true vine</strong> (John 15:1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Revelation, he continues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the Alpha and the Omega</strong> (Revelation 1:8, 1:17, 22:13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM the first and the last</strong> (Revelation 1:17)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And he promises:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM with you always</strong> (Matthew 28:20)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>The True Teaching: “I AM” Saves</strong></h3>
<p>These aren’t poetic flourishes. Each “I AM” statement calls you to realise that your own awareness is divine and creative.</p>
<p>When Jesus says, <strong>I AM the way</strong>, he is not talking about an external worship practice — he is revealing that your own <strong>assumed state of being</strong> is the way to transformation.</p>
<p>When he says, <strong>I AM the resurrection</strong>, he is showing that by assuming <strong>I AM</strong> a new person (<strong>I AM healed</strong>, <strong>I AM prosperous</strong>, <strong>I AM joyful</strong>), you resurrect yourself into a new life.</p>
<p>The Bible repeats: <strong>I AM</strong> is the power, the saviour, and the source. It is your consciousness — the awareness that declares <strong>I AM</strong>, before you add any condition.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>A Living Invitation</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of waiting for something outside to save you, Scripture invites you to take responsibility: choose consciously what you claim as <strong>I AM</strong>.</p>
<p>When you declare <strong>I AM free</strong>, <strong>I AM loved</strong>, <strong>I AM whole</strong>, you use the divine name to transform your world.</p>
