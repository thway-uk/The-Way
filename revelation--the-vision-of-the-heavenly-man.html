<h1>Revelation — The Vision of the Heavenly Man</h1>
<p><strong>Revelation 1:9-20</strong> reveals the stunning vision of the <strong>new ideal self</strong>—the fully awakened consciousness made in the desired new self image, a theme foundational to the Bible from <strong>Genesis 1:26</strong> onward.</p><p></p><blockquote>“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...’”</blockquote><p></p><p>John’s vision of the “<a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">Son of Man</a>” walking among seven golden candlesticks symbolises this emergent self, fully realised and active within every stage of deliberate transformation.</p><hr /><h3>The Son of Man Among the Candlesticks: The Awakened Ideal Self</h3><blockquote>
<p>And in the middle of them one like a son of man, clothed with a robe down to his feet, and with a band of gold round his breasts.</p><p>And his head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p><p>And his feet like polished brass, as if it had been burned in a fire; and his voice was as the sound of great waters.<em>.”</em> (Revelation 1:13)</p>
</blockquote><p>This figure represents the <strong>ideal <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">self</a> fully realised</strong>—the uplifted imagination clothed in authority and power.</p><p>The seven golden candlesticks are the stages or states of consciousness through which the new self matures. The “<a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">Son of Man</a>” walking among them shows imagination present and active in every phase of the inner journey.</p><blockquote>
<p>Here, the “Son of Man” represents the self as it is in the process of awakening— actively practicing the law of Assumption. According to Neville Goddard, this contrasts with the “Son of God,” which is the fully realised divine imagination, the “I AM” beyond limitation.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>Daniel’s Vision: The Emergence of Divine Authority</h3><p>This vision echoes Daniel 10:5-8, where Daniel's <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a> appears:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“</em>And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe, and round him there was a band of gold, of the best gold:</p><p>And his body was like the beryl, and his face had the look of a thunder-flame, and his eyes were like burning lights, and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass, and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army..”</p>
</blockquote><p>Daniel’s man is not a distant figure but the <strong>emergent new self </strong>assuming authority over the inner kingdom—the mind and imagination.</p><p>This vision speaks to the transformation and authority of the new self, as it takes dominion over its own imaginative faculties.</p><hr /><h3>The Song of Solomon: The Beloved Imaginal Self</h3><p>The Song of Solomon poetically describes the beloved with imagery of beauty and power:</p><blockquote>
<p><i>“</i>His eyes are like doves by the rivers of waters... his countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars... his mouth is most sweet...” (Song of Solomon 5:12-13)</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard sees this beloved as the <strong>imaginal self</strong>, the inward divine presence that the seeker must come to know and embody.</p><p>The beloved’s beauty and strength symbolise the perfected imagination—the ideal self that births love, creativity, and life.</p><hr /><h3>Jacob and Esau: The Power of Imaginative Assumption</h3><p>The story of <a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">Jacob assuming Esau’s identity</a> (Genesis 27) illustrates the key Neville teaching that <strong>imaginative assumption precedes manifestation</strong>.</p><p>Jacob dresses as Esau to receive his father’s blessing, demonstrating that to become the new self, one must <strong>“live in the feeling of the wish fulfilled”</strong>—to act and feel as the desired self before external evidence appears.</p><p>This imaginative shift is the practical step in forming the ideal self revealed in Revelation.</p><blockquote>
<p>This act of assumption marks the journey from the Son of Man—still striving and limited—toward the Son of God—the fully realised self that lives from the place of fulfilled identity.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>Wrestling for Transformation: Jacob’s Inner Battle</h3><p><a href="/2025/05/jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">Jacob’s wrestling with the man</a> (Genesis 32) symbolises the inner struggle to fully embody the new identity.</p><p>This conflict is necessary to overcome old limiting beliefs and false identities.</p><p>When Jacob prevails and is renamed Israel, it signifies the birth of the transformed consciousness—the ideal self that walks consciously among the candlesticks of spiritual growth.</p><hr /><h3>The Bible’s Unified Teaching on the New Ideal Self</h3><p>Across these scriptures, the Bible presents a unified narrative:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:26</strong> lays the blueprint—the divine image within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daniel 10:5-8</strong> reveals the ideal self emerging into authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon</strong> paints the beauty and power of the imaginal self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jacob’s story</strong> shows the necessity of assumption and inner struggle to become this new self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revelation 1:9-20</strong> culminates the vision—the awakened ideal self walking through stages of consciousness with divine authority.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Conclusion: Your Own Emergent Divine Self</h3><p>Revelation 1:9-20 is not a distant prophecy but a living vision of your own <strong>emergent consciousness</strong>.</p><p>The “Son of Man” is your awakened imagination, clothed in the authority of “I AM.” The candlesticks are the inner states you illuminate as you grow.</p><p>Jacob’s example teaches you to assume the identity you desire and wrestle with old self-concepts to fully embody your divine creative power.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>Ultimately, this journey moves from the Son of Man—the human self awakening—to the Son of God—the divine imagination fully realised within you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville Goddard’s teachings invite you to recognise this ideal self within you, waiting to be fully realised and expressed in your life.</p>
