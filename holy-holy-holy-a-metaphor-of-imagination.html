    <h1>“Holy, Holy, Holy”: A Metaphor of Imagination</h1>
    <p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.”</em>— <em>Isaiah 6:3</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p>This is not about ritual praise — it is a profound revelation of the imagination.</p><p>The “<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Lord of Hosts</a>” is not a deity external to man, but the creative power within: the imagination, which commands the invisible hosts of thought, mood, and movement. It is through this power that all things are made. To call it <em>holy</em> <a href="/search/label/Numbers%3A%20Three">three times</a> is to intensify recognition — a building awareness that this faculty, often overlooked, is in fact sacred.</p><p><em>Holy</em> means set apart — not by distance, but by nature. Imagination is unseen, yet it is the true cause of everything seen. The triple “holy” is a progressive awakening to its reality and supremacy.</p><p>Then comes the declaration:<br />
<em>“The whole earth is full of His glory.”</em></p><p>This is not a poetic flourish — it is a metaphysical truth. The “earth” symbolises the manifest world, and “His glory” is the radiance of what imagination has assumed to be true. <em>He</em> is the assumption itself. The moment an inner state is accepted as real, it begins to clothe itself in form. Every corner of one’s world becomes filled with the echoes of that inner act.</p><p>What you assume in imagination becomes visible in experience. The earth — your world — reflects back the glory of what you believe and persist in inwardly.</p><p>This passage is not doctrine. It is dynamic instruction:<br />
Your assumption is holy.<br />
Imagination is the Lord.<br />
And the world is full of what you’ve dared to see within.</p>
