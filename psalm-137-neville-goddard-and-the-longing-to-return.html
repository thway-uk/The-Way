    <h1>Psalm 137: Neville Goddard and the Longing to Return</h1>
    <p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.”</em></blockquote><p></p><p>
— <strong>Psalm 137:1</strong></p>
<p>Psalm 137 speaks to a deep inner ache — not just homesickness, but a spiritual forgetting. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this isn’t about history; it’s about <strong>states of consciousness</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Babylon</strong> symbolises separation — the outer world of facts, fear, and limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zion</strong> is remembrance — the state of unity with the “I AM”, where desire and imagination are one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be in Babylon is to feel powerless. To remember Zion is to begin the journey back to your creative centre.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>What the Symbols Mean</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“By the rivers of Babylon…”</strong><br />
The rivers represent emotional overwhelm — being carried by feelings instead of directing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“We wept when we remembered Zion.”</strong><br />
Deep within, we know there’s a higher state — one where imagination rules. Remembering it brings both pain and hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“We hanged our harps upon the willows.”</strong><br />
The harp is imagination. To hang it up means giving up, letting the outer world silence the inner one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?”</strong><br />
This is the challenge of all manifestation: how to live from the wish fulfilled in the middle of opposite facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“If I forget thee, O Jerusalem…”</strong><br />
Jerusalem is inner clarity. To forget it is to lose conscious control — to let imagination be shaped by the world, instead of the other way round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Happy shall he be… that dasheth thy little ones…”</strong><br />
Spiritually, this is about stopping negative thoughts at birth — refusing to entertain ideas rooted in separation and fear.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Psalm 137 isn’t just a lament. It’s a reminder. Even in Babylon, you can <em>remember</em> Zion.<br />
Even when imagination feels buried, you can take it up again.</p>
<p>Your power was never lost — only forgotten.</p>
<p>So sing. Imagine. Return.</p>
