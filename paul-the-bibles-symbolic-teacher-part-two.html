    <h1>Paul: The Bible’s Symbolic Teacher PART TWO</h1>
    <p>The Bible has long mystified readers. For some, it is a book of literal history and law. For others, it is something more profound: a spiritual manual encoded in symbol and parable, speaking to the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">inner world of man.</a> But what does the Bible itself say about how it should be read? In its own words, the symbolic interpretation doesn’t just hold up—it triumphs.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the key passages where the Bible directly points us inward, away from the surface letter and into the realm of spiritual meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“The letter gives death, but the spirit gives life”</h3>
<p>— 2 Corinthians 3:6, BBE</p>
<p>This is Paul at his clearest. The “letter” is the literal reading of the text, and it gives death—not in the sense of physical harm, but in spiritual stagnation. Literalism fixes the mind on outward obedience, judgement, and fear. It cuts us off from transformation.</p>
<p>The spirit, by contrast, gives life. This is the symbolic reading—one that treats each story as a mirror of the soul. In this mode, the Bible becomes a tool for awakening, not merely a rulebook for behaviour.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“These things are an allegory”</h3>
<p>— Galatians 4:24, BBE</p>
<p>Paul, again, offers a direct declaration: the story of Abraham, <a href="/2025/05/hagar-and-sarah-battle-between-outer.html">Sarah, and Hagar</a> is not historical—it is symbolic. He interprets the two women as representing two covenants: one from the mountain of Sinai bringing bondage, and one representing freedom.</p>
<p>If such foundational characters are allegories, we are being given permission—if not outright instruction—to read the rest in the same way.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“It is the glory of God to keep a thing secret: but the glory of kings is to have it searched out”</h3>
<p>— Proverbs 25:2, BBE</p>
<p>The divine intention is concealment. God hides truth in symbolic wrapping, and it is the work of a king—a spiritually awakened seeker—to uncover it. This is not a book of open answers but a mystery to be unveiled.</p>
<p>The Bible does not resist interpretation—it demands it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“And he said to them, Is it not clear to you even now? have your hearts no sense of what is right? Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, do you not hear?”</h3>
<p>— Mark 8:17–18, BBE</p>
<p>Jesus rebukes his disciples not for lacking knowledge, but for failing to perceive. These are not criticisms of their physical senses, but of their inner awareness. The literal mind sees bread and fishes. The awakened mind sees abundance, faith, and divine law.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“All these things Jesus said to the people in stories; and without a story he said nothing to them”</h3>
<p>— Matthew 13:34, BBE</p>
<p>Jesus never spoke without a parable. These are not simple illustrations—they are symbolic tales, encrypted with spiritual truth. In the same chapter, he explains why:</p>
<p>“Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, and the sense is not clear to them.” — Matthew 13:13, BBE</p>
<p>Symbolism wasn’t a flourish—it was a necessity.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“The kingdom of God does not come with watching for it… the kingdom of God is among you.”</h3>
<p>— Luke 17:20–21, BBE</p>
<p>When the Pharisees demanded to know when the <a href="/2025/07/the-kingdom-of-god-entering-through.html">kingdom</a> would appear, Jesus redirected them inward. They were looking for signs and history; he pointed them to the inner world. The kingdom is not something to observe. It is a state of being, a realisation, a consciousness. So is scripture.</p>
<hr />
<h3>“He who has ears, let him give ear.”</h3>
<p>— Matthew 13:9, BBE</p>
<p>A phrase Jesus repeated often. Not everyone hears what is being said. To hear symbolically is to listen with the heart—not just the head. These words separate the literal hearer from the spiritual seeker.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Symbolism Reveals the Inner World</h2>
<p>When we read symbolically, Egypt is no longer a nation—it is a mental bondage. The wilderness becomes a season of doubt. Goliath is the fear within, not a giant without. Jesus walking on water symbolises mastery over the unstable subconscious, not physics-defying spectacle.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not secular history but spiritual autobiography. These scriptures support that claim. The stories echo in us because they are us.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Bible Invites You Inward</h2>
<p>The verdict is clear. The literal reading stifles, divides, and judges. The symbolic reading awakens, unites, and transforms.</p>
<p>As Jesus said:</p>
<p>“The kingdom of God is among you.” — Luke 17:21, BBE</p>
<p>And so is the truth of scripture.</p>
