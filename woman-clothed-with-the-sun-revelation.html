    <h1>Woman Clothed With The Sun: Revelation</h1>
    <p><strong>With a Comparison to Song of Solomon 6:10–12</strong></p><p>The Bible is not a historical or religious text—it is the epic drama of human consciousness unfolding. According to Neville Goddard, its stories are metaphors and symbols revealing the workings of your own imagination. Each character, place, and event is a state of being or a movement within your psyche.</p><p>When seen this way, the Bible becomes a living guide for self-transformation. It maps the journey from outer limitation to inner divine awareness—from the bondage of old beliefs to the freedom of new assumptions.</p><hr /><h4>Revelation 12:1–6 — The Inner Birth of a New Self</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</strong><br />
<strong>And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</strong><br />
<strong>And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</strong><br />
<strong>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</strong><br />
<strong>And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</strong><br />
<strong>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.”</strong> <em>(KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This woman is the awakened subconscious imagination, the divine feminine within you—the fertile womb where new states of consciousness are formed.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clothed with the sun</strong>: Wrapped in spiritual illumination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moon under her feet</strong>: She stands above fluctuating emotion and reflected reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crown of twelve stars</strong>: Complete spiritual authority, possibly the twelve faculties of man aligned with higher awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Her travail in giving birth is the inner struggle of shifting identity—the discomfort and tension experienced when you move from the known to the newly assumed “I AM.” The great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, is symbolic of doubt, habitual logic, and the dominance of the five senses—the voice of disbelief that threatens your new creation.</p><p>The man child she births is the firm assumption of your divine nature, fixed in your consciousness (“caught up unto God and His throne”). The woman’s flight into the wilderness signifies the waiting period of manifestation—a time of faith, persistence, and unseen nurturing.</p><hr /><h4>Song of Solomon 6:10–12 — The Radiant Beloved</h4><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</strong><br />
<strong>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</strong><br />
<strong>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.”</strong> <em>(KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the woman is the imaginative response to the birth of new consciousness—radiant, beautiful, and powerful.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Fair as the moon, clear as the sun”</strong> echoes Revelation’s symbolism of the woman clothed with the sun and standing on the moon, expressing spiritual illumination and mastery over emotional fluctuation and reflective reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Terrible as an army with banners”</strong> (also translated as “awesome” or “majestic”) expresses the awe-inspiring power and commanding presence of the awakened imagination—like a mighty army with banners advancing decisively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The swift, powerful movement expressed in “my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib” resonates with the woman fleeing into the wilderness in Revelation, moving through the unseen spaces with faith and strength toward manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h4>One Woman — Two Expressions of the Imaginative “I AM”</h4><p>Both passages reveal <strong>the same inner woman</strong>—the awakened imaginative self, your inner “I AM”—presented in complementary ways:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Revelation 12</strong>, she is the active, creative force in labour, birthing new identity, crowned with divine authority, and standing victorious over doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Song of Solomon 6</strong>, she is the radiant beloved, the beautiful and powerful imaginative response that rises in joy and majesty as new states of being become assured and take hold.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, they portray a complete picture of spiritual transformation: the creative birthing act and the victorious emergence of your imaginative self, radiating strength and majesty.</p><hr /><h4>Conclusion: The Divine Drama Within</h4><p>Revelation 12 and Song of Solomon 6 invite you to recognise the woman within—the creative imaginative power that births your new reality and rejoices in her strength. Doubt and resistance may roar like the red dragon, but persistence in your assumption of “I AM” will see your new self rise and rule.</p><p>As Neville Goddard said:<br />
<strong>“You give birth to that which you are conscious of being.”</strong></p><p>Hold fast to the radiant woman within, your creative “I AM.” Let the child be born. Let the imagination move swiftly and powerfully like an army with banners. Your world will reshape itself in the image of your inner conviction.</p>
