    <h1>The Symbolism of Kings in the Bible: Rulership of Evolving Awareness Towards the Christ</h1>
    <p>In traditional readings, the kings of the Bible are seen as historical rulers—men who reigned over nations, led armies, and governed with varying levels of virtue or corruption. But when we interpret Scripture through the teachings of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, these kings become far more than external figures. They symbolise <strong>inner states of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a></strong>, each taking the throne of the mind as it matures toward divine awareness.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Kings as Inner Rulers</strong></h3><p>According to Neville, every character in the Bible reflects a psychological state or process. Kings, therefore, represent the <strong>dominant mental states</strong> ruling over our internal world. Each king embodies a form of <strong>rulership over our thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions</strong>—influencing not just how we feel, but what we ultimately manifest in the outer world.</p><p>Just as a king dictates the laws of a land, your current state of consciousness determines the “rules” by which your life unfolds.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Rise and Fall of Mental Thrones</strong></h3><p>The Bible's long narrative of kings rising and falling is a <strong>symbolic record of inner transformation</strong>. Consciousness does not remain static; old mental rulers must fall away so that new ones may take their place.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul</strong>, the first king chosen by the people, represents a <strong>reactive, externally-governed state</strong> of mind—one that clings to appearances and fears loss of control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong>, the one chosen by God, symbolises a <strong>spiritually-aligned rulership</strong>—a conscious decision to govern the self through faith, intuition, and creative imagination.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each transfer of power from one king to another mirrors the internal shift from one dominant state of mind to a more awakened one.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jesus: The Fulfilment of Conscious Rulership</strong></h3><p>The narrative of kingship culminates in <strong>Jesus</strong>—not as a political king, but as the embodiment of the perfected imagination. In Neville’s framework, Jesus is the final and eternal ruler, the full realisation of divine consciousness within. He is not separate from us but represents the state we are destined to enter: one of harmonious rulership over our entire being.</p><p>This is not a far-off spiritual ideal, but a <strong>psychological awakening</strong>. Jesus symbolises the point where the mind is no longer divided, no longer ruled by conflict, fear, or doubt—but unified, purposeful, and creative.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Your Inner Kingdom</strong></h3><p>The Bible's lineage of kings serves as an <strong>allegory of your own spiritual journey</strong>. Each king is a reflection of who or what currently governs your inner world.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Are you ruled by Saul—living from fear, resistance, or external approval?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or have you crowned David—living from imagination, conviction, and divine guidance?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Every moment you shift from fear to faith, from passivity to vision, you enthrone a new king. And each of these shifts brings you closer to the rulership of Christ—the state of <strong>conscious, deliberate creation</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: Reclaiming the Throne Within</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s teachings, the Bible is not a historical record—it is <strong>your personal spiritual blueprint</strong>. The kings within its pages are not distant monarchs, but present rulers of your inner kingdom.</p><p>To read the story of kings is to read the story of <strong>your own evolving rulership</strong>—each new awareness a coronation, each discarded limitation a dethronement. And as you rise through these states of consciousness, you approach the throne of your true identity: the Christ within, the rightful king of your life.</p>
