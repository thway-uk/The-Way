    <h1>The “Abomination of Desolation” in Daniel</h1>
    <p>The phrase <strong>“abomination of desolation”</strong> appears in the Book of Daniel in three significant passages (Daniel 9:27, 11:31, and 12:11). Rather than a prediction about external historical events, these passages symbolise <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">inner states of consciousness</a> that affect your experience of reality. </p><hr /><h3>Breaking Down the Daniel Passages</h3><p><strong>Daniel 9:27</strong><br />
<em>“He will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple, he will set up an abomination that causes desolation.”</em></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Temple:</strong> Your inner consciousness — the sacred mental space where your self-concept and creative imagination live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sacrifice and offering:</strong> The ongoing, conscious acts of faith, focus, and assumption — the “daily sacrifice” you offer to manifest your desires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abomination that causes desolation:</strong> A false or limiting belief that takes root inside, disrupting your faith and creative flow, resulting in inner barrenness or desolation.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><p><strong>Daniel 11:31</strong><br />
<em>“His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.”</em></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Armed forces:</strong> Persistent negative thoughts, fears, or doubts that attack your inner sanctuary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Desecrate the temple fortress:</strong> These negative forces disrupt and weaken your mental stronghold, your confident self-assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abolish the daily sacrifice:</strong> The interruption or abandonment of your imaginative practice and faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up the abomination:</strong> The takeover by false beliefs that “pollute” your inner temple and cause spiritual emptiness.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><p><strong>Daniel 12:11</strong><br />
<em>“From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.”</em></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1,290 days:</strong> A symbolic timeframe representing the period during which limiting beliefs dominate, causing inner struggle and stagnation until conscious change is made.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>The Inner Temple and Its Defilement</h3><p>The <strong>temple</strong> is a metaphor for your <strong>innermost consciousness</strong> — the place where your identity and imagination work together to create your experience. Maintaining the <strong>daily sacrifice</strong> is maintaining faith and alignment with your desired reality.</p><p>The <strong>“abomination”</strong> symbolizes any <strong>false, limiting, or negative assumptions</strong> that take over your inner space, disrupting your connection to your true creative power. When these assumptions stand unchecked, they cause <strong>desolation</strong> — a barren mental state where your imagination’s power is blocked.</p><hr /><h3>The Call to Awareness</h3><p>The phrase “let the reader understand” is a clear call to become aware of what assumptions you hold inside. It urges you to examine your inner temple, identify false beliefs, and consciously replace them with empowering assumptions.</p><hr /><h3>Transformation Through Assumption</h3><p>According to the Law of Assumption:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Your outer reality is a mirror of your inner assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By assuming the feeling of your fulfilled desire and displacing limiting beliefs, you cleanse your inner temple of the “abomination.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This restores harmony, creativity, and flow, transforming desolation into abundance.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Summary</h3><p>The “abomination of desolation” is a vivid, symbolic representation of the false assumptions that invade and pollute your inner consciousness, blocking your creative power. The passages in Daniel offer a psychological map showing how inner conflict between faith and doubt plays out in your consciousness and manifests as your reality.</p><p>Understanding this symbol invites you to guard your inner temple vigilantly, maintain your daily sacrifice of faith and imagination, and consciously transform limiting beliefs to restore your creative authority and manifest your desires.</p>
