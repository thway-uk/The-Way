<h1>The Full Meaning of the Name Jesus: A Hebrew and Spiritual Breakdown</h1>
<p>The name <strong>Jesus</strong> is one of the most recognised in the world, yet few realise the depth and power encoded in its original Hebrew form. When examined closely—linguistically and spiritually—it reveals profound truths about salvation, identity, and the nature of divine awareness.</p><hr /><h2>1. Original Hebrew Name</h2><p>The name <strong>Jesus</strong> originates from the Hebrew:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>יְהוֹשׁוּעַ</strong> (<em>Yehoshua</em>)<br />
Or its shortened form: <strong>יֵשׁוּעַ</strong> (<em>Yeshua</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>Both forms carry the essential meaning:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Yahweh is salvation”</strong><br />
Or more personally: <strong>“God saves” / “The LORD is my salvation”</strong></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2>2. Breakdown of the Name</h2><p><strong>Yehoshua / Yeshua</strong> is composed of two key parts:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Yah" (יָה)</strong> – A shortened form of <strong>YHWH</strong> (the sacred name of God, often rendered as Yahweh)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"yasha" (יָשַׁע)</strong> – A verb meaning <em>to save, deliver, or rescue</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, they create a name that declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Yahweh saves”</strong><br />
Or: <strong>“The I AM saves”</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>According to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, <em>I AM</em> is not just a phrase but <strong>the divine name of God</strong> (Exodus 3:14). In this light, the name takes on a personal, psychological meaning:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Jesus = “I AM” (your own awareness) is your saviour</strong></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2>3. From Hebrew to English</h2><p>As the name passed through languages, it evolved in form but not in meaning:</p><table>

</table><p>Though the letters changed, the spiritual message remained: <strong>salvation through divine presence</strong>.</p><hr /><h2>4. YHVH – The Blueprint of Creation</h2><p><strong>YHVH</strong> is often translated as “the LORD” in English Bibles, but Neville insisted this name is actually the <strong>formula of creation</strong>—a pattern embedded in your very consciousness. Using the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html" target="_blank">Mather's Table</a>, the four Hebrew letters reveal the movement from invisible thought to visible fact:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod (י)</strong> – A tiny point, a seed, a hand reaching forth. It symbolises the initial desire, the origin of all creation in imagination. This is the spark, the moment you form an intention or entertain a possibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> – The window. In Neville’s framework, this is the opening of the imagination—the space where you form an inner picture. The first He represents the inner conception, the imagined scene felt as real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav (ו)</strong> – The nail or hook. This is where the idea becomes fixed in the mind through feeling. Neville taught that <em>feeling is the secret</em>; Vav is the moment of attachment, where you unite with the state you desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He (ה)</strong> – Again the window—but now it symbolises external expression. The second He shows the outpicturing of the assumption, when the unseen becomes seen. It is imagination hardened into fact.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Yod → He → Vav → He</strong><br />
<strong>Desire → Conception → Fixation → Manifestation</strong></p><p>This divine name is not reserved for a distant God—it is the pattern by which every being creates their world. When you assume something to be true and persist in that assumption, the process described by YHVH unfolds within you.</p><p>The number four recurs as a blueprint for creative consciousness—embodied in the four rivers flowing from Eden, the four living creatures in Ezekiel’s vision, and the four Gospels—all pointing to the fourfold creative process (desire, inner conception, feeling of reality, manifestation). In each instance, “four” signifies completeness: it marks the transition from seed thought to realised state, reflecting how a sustained assumption establishes a new state of awareness.</p><hr /><h2>5. Related Names and Their Connections</h2><p>Many other names share this root:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Joshua</strong> – Another English form of Yehoshua; same origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hoshea</strong> – An older variation meaning simply <em>salvation</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isa (عيسى)</strong> – The Arabic form used in the Qur’an, derived from Aramaic.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All echo the central theme: <strong>rescue and salvation through divine power</strong>.</p><hr /><h2>6. The Neville Goddard Interpretation</h2><p>Neville Goddard taught that <strong>Jesus is not only a historical figure but the representation of your own awakened imagination</strong>. To him, Jesus means:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Your “I AM” — your awareness of being — is the only saviour.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>You are not saved by worshipping an external figure, but by <strong>consciously assuming</strong> the identity and outcome you desire. Jesus, then, is <strong>the saving power of your own being</strong>.</p><hr /><h2>In Summary</h2><table>

</table><hr /><p>This ancient name isn't just about history or religion—it’s about the <strong>power of consciousness</strong> to transform your life. <strong>Jesus means salvation through the awareness of “I AM.”</strong> And that power is yours to assume.</p>
