<h1>Cloven Hooves, Fins, and Wings: Animals and The Psychology of Clean and Unclean</h1>
<p>Among the more obscure-sounding laws in the Old Testament is the one that speaks of dietary restrictions in Leviticus 11. These practices are a somewhat crude attempt at the law of Assumption before it evolves into the ministry of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>.  <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> commands <a href="/2025/04/israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel</a> to eat only those animals that both <strong>chew the cud</strong> and have a <strong>split hoof</strong>. Those that do only one are unclean:</p><blockquote>
<p>“You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.” – Leviticus 11:3<br />
“But you must not eat those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.” – Leviticus 11:4 </p>
</blockquote><p>At face value, these sound like dietary rules. But according to Neville Goddard and the Law of Assumption, every detail in Scripture is symbolic of your own <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>. These “animals” are not external creatures, but <strong>inner states</strong>—mental and emotional energies, assumptions, qualities of thought and reaction.</p><p>Scripture's ritualistic portrayal of laws like this reveals something deeper: the mind grappling with a new principle—the <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Law of Assumption—while still trapped in the forms of </a>external religion. These early stories are not errors, but records of a transitional understanding. Inner understanding is being filtered through outer ritual. And that same confusion persists today. Many still approach the Law of Assumption as if it were a technique to perform, rather than a state to embody—turning inner transformation into spiritual theatre.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Naming the Inner States</strong></h2><p>In Genesis 2:19–20, <a href="/2025/05/how-biblical-names-reflect-shifts-in.html">Adam names the animals</a>—not as a zoologist, but symbolically. Adam is awareness itself, defining experience:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And whatever name Adam gave to every living thing, that was its name.” – Genesis 2:19</p>
</blockquote><p>This act of naming represents your power to define states within. You label the energies that rise in consciousness—fear, peace, joy, frustration—and thereby assign them reality in your world. To name is to claim.</p><p>Likewise, in a verse echoing foundational premise <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">Genesis 1:11</a>, Genesis 1:24 reads:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Let the earth give birth to all sorts of living beings... after their sort.” – Genesis 1:24</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, "the earth" symbolises your subconscious mind, and the “beasts” are the instinctual reactions, beliefs, and assumptions that arise from it. Each manifests "after its kind"—every assumption bears fruit after its own nature.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Leviticus 11 and Inner Discernment</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>“You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.” – Leviticus 11:3<br />
“But you must not eat those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof…” – Leviticus 11:4</p>
</blockquote><p>To "eat" symbolically means to <strong>internalise</strong>, to <strong>absorb as part of self</strong>. Leviticus 11 tells you to internalise only those states which combine <strong>discernment</strong> and <strong>mental digestion</strong>.</p><h3>🐄 Symbolism Breakdown:</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Split hoof</strong> = The ability to walk in <strong>divided awareness</strong>: to tread the physical world while rooted in spiritual conviction. It’s faith in the unseen, the power to live “as though” even when facts contradict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chewing the cud</strong> = <strong>Mental digestion</strong>: to revisit the same assumption in imagination, like a cow regurgitating and chewing. It reflects revision, meditation, and inner persistence.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, these form a spiritually “clean” state: one that walks in awareness of the unseen and persistently revisits its desired outcome in imagination.</p><hr /><h3>❌ Unclean Combinations (as per Scripture):</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Camel (chews cud, no split hoof)</strong> → Symbolises <em>obsessive rumination without spiritual detachment</em>. You keep revisiting ideas mentally, but lack the faith or ability to walk in their assumption. You’re stuck in analysis, not application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pig (split hoof, doesn’t chew cud)</strong> → Symbolises <em>outer performance without inner revision</em>. You walk in the world with the appearance of discernment, but without sustained inner focus or meditation on the assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In both cases, the inner state is “unclean”—not in a moral sense, but in being unfit to produce manifestation.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Sea Creatures: Navigating Emotional Depth</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>“These you may eat of all that are in the waters: everything... that has fins and scales.” – Leviticus 11:9<br />
“But... that does not have fins and scales... is detestable to you.” – Leviticus 11:10</p>
</blockquote><h3>🐟 Symbolism of Fins and Scales:</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fins</strong> = Directional movement. The power to <strong>steer</strong> yourself through emotional depths without being swept away. An assumption with clear aim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scales</strong> = Protection. Mental <strong>guardrails</strong>—disciplined thought that shields you from suggestion or negativity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An assumption without <strong>fins</strong> (no direction) or without <strong>scales</strong> (no protection) is unfit. You are not to “eat” it—i.e. don’t identify with or internalise chaotic, unfocused, or unguarded emotional states.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Birds: States of Thought and Spirit</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>“Every raven, and every hawk, and every seagull… will be unclean.” – Leviticus 11:13–19 (BBE, paraphrased)</p>
</blockquote><p>Birds of prey and scavengers are symbolic of <strong>mental states that feed on decay</strong>—fear, judgement, comparison. These are reactive thoughts rather than creative ones. They live off what dies, what fails, what others leave behind.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ravens, vultures, hawks</strong> = Thoughts that scavenge: unworthy beliefs inherited from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Owls and night creatures</strong> = Introspection that turns toward fear instead of faith—spiritual confusion, operating in darkness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>By contrast, <strong>doves and sparrows</strong>—frequent biblical symbols—represent clean, inspired thought. These are not banned.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Flying Insects: Jumping or Crawling?</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p>“All winged insects that go on all fours are to be looked on as disgusting to you.” – Leviticus 11:20<br />
“But… those which have legs for jumping… you may eat.” – Leviticus 11:21</p>
</blockquote><p>Flying insects that crawl symbolise dual-minded, unstable thoughts—<strong>inspired yet earthbound</strong>, flitting between faith and fear. These represent states caught in contradiction: capable of flight but still crawling in reaction.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unclean</strong> = Flying creatures that crawl. Inspiration that never lifts off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean</strong> = Grasshoppers, locusts—those that leap. States that <em>rise</em>, shift, transcend.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2><strong>Adam, Again: Naming Determines Nature</strong></h2><p>Returning to Genesis 2:19, Adam names the creatures—just as you name your inner state. You may call it “lack,” “rejection,” “unworthiness”—and so it becomes. Or you may name it “joy,” “peace,” or “fulfilment”—and your world reflects that.</p><p>Neville Goddard often said that <strong>you become what you accept as true</strong>, and that <strong>inner conversations are prayers</strong>. The naming of animals isn’t zoological—it’s spiritual authorship.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Conclusion: What You “Eat” Becomes You</strong></h2><p>The Levitical laws, in symbolic form, instruct you to be <strong>selective about what you internalise</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Only internalise assumptions that walk with discernment (split hoof) <strong>and</strong> are revisited in meditation (chewing the cud).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only accept thoughts that are both directional (fins) <strong>and</strong> protected (scales).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reject states that live off death, judgment, or stagnation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace those that rise, leap, or evolve.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>That is what it means to walk by faith, not by sight.<br />
That is what it means to eat only what is “clean.”<br />
That is the Law of Assumption.</p></blockquote>
