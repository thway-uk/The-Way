— <em>Genesis 1:11</em></p>
<p>This verse in Genesis might seem like a simple agricultural moment in the <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">creation story when the first pure assumption was made</a>. But when interpreted through the teachings of Neville Goddard, it reveals a fundamental metaphysical truth: <strong>everything reproduces after its kind</strong> because <strong>the seed is in itself</strong>—a direct metaphor for how <strong>imagination creates reality</strong>. It's the first mention of the <a href="/2025/05/the-garden-within-trees-rivers-and-flow.html">two trees</a> in the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Garden of Eden</a>.</p>
<h3>The Seed Within Itself: A Core Principle of Manifestation</h3>
<p>Neville often stressed that your <strong>imagination contains the power to create your world</strong>. What you <strong>assume</strong> to be true in imagination plants a seed. And just as in Genesis 1:11, <strong>that seed contains everything needed to reproduce itself</strong>—after its kind.</p>
<p>This means if you imagine from a state of joy, you will reap joy. If you imagine from fear, you will produce fear. The seed of experience comes from <strong>your internal state</strong>, not external conditions.</p>
<p>There is no need to look outside yourself. The seed—the cause of your future—is already <strong>within you</strong>. It is <strong>self-contained</strong>, just as the Bible says. This, Neville taught, is the divine principle behind all creation.</p>
<h3>A Nod to 111: The Significance of Oneness</h3>
<p>It’s not coincidental that this powerful verse is marked <strong>Genesis 1:11</strong>. The number <strong>111</strong> symbolises <strong>oneness</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, and the <strong>primacy of thought</strong>. In many metaphysical teachings, 111 appears when you're being reminded that <strong>your thoughts are creating your reality</strong>.</p>
<p>In a way, <strong>Genesis 1:11 is the Bible’s 111 moment</strong>—quietly but boldly announcing that everything comes from within, that <strong>form follows consciousness</strong>, and that life emerges not from effort but from inner alignment.</p>
<p>Neville often said that <strong>imagining creates reality</strong> and that the imagination is the Christ within. When we observe the world as something “out there,” we remain trapped in the illusion. But when we realise the <strong>seed is in us</strong>, we return to the core truth: <strong>I am the creative power</strong>.</p>
<h3>Made in His Image: The Echo of Divine Imagination</h3>
<p>Later in Genesis, we read:</p>
<p><em>"So <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">God created man</a> in his own image, in the image of God created he him."</em><br />
— <em>Genesis 1:27</em></p>
<p>Neville taught that being made in God's image does not mean we look like a physical being in the sky. It means we share God's nature: <strong>we imagine, we create</strong>, and we bring forth life through consciousness.</p>
<p>God imagined the world into being. And now, as an individualised expression of God, <strong>you</strong> do the same.</p>
<p>To be <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">made in God’s image</a> is to be <strong>the imaginer</strong>. Your awareness, your assumptions, your mental conversations—these are the <strong>spiritual seeds</strong>. And Genesis 1:11 reminds us: these seeds carry within them all that is necessary for manifestation.</p><p></p><blockquote>"Therefore be <i>imitators</i> of God..." — Ephesians 5:1 ESV</blockquote><p></p>
<h3>The Principle of Self-Containment</h3>
<p>This is perhaps the most radical and freeing idea Neville conveyed: <strong>You need nothing outside yourself</strong> to manifest your life.</p>
<p>The seed—your imaginative act—is <strong>complete within itself</strong>. You don’t need to chase, strive, beg, or wait. You only need to plant and persist in the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>And just like in Genesis 1:11, <strong>it was so</strong>.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts: You Are the Sower</h3>
<p>Genesis 1:11, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s understanding, isn’t about plants or trees. It’s about <strong>you</strong>. You are the <strong>sower</strong>, and the world is your field. Every thought, feeling, and inner assumption is a <strong>seed within itself</strong>, and it will produce after its kind.</p>
<p>You don’t need permission, a sign, or the right conditions. You’ve already been given the image, the seed, and the soil. All that remains is to imagine deliberately—and let <strong>it be so</strong>.</p>
