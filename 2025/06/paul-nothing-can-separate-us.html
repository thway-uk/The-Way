<h1>Paul: Nothing Can Separate Us</h1>
<blockquote><p>“No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.<br />
For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,<br />
nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”<br />
— Romans 8:37–39</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a quiet, radiant beauty in Paul’s words in Romans 8:37–39 here. A kind of poetry that speaks not of struggle, but of unbreakable union.</p>
<p>This passage is not shouting in triumph—it’s whispering of a deep certainty, the kind that settles into the heart like still water.</p>
<p>According to Neville Goddard’s teaching, this love is not abstract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The love of God in Christ Jesus” is your awareness of being, your felt unity with the state of imagination you choose to dwell in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The love of God (<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>) in <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Christ Jesus our Lord</a> (Imagination).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing you could do, feel, or fear that can truly separate you from that love—because it <strong>is you</strong>. It is the truth that runs beneath all seeming conditions.</p>
<p>Neither death nor life,<br />
neither past regrets nor future unknowns,<br />
neither emotions high or low—<br />
none of it can undo the still, beautiful connection between your assumption and its fulfilment when it is rooted in love.</p>
<p>Here, Paul deliberately uses the language of <em><a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">inseparability</a></em> to echo the principle first laid out in <strong>Genesis 2:24</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html"><em>cleave</em> means to love so deeply that one joins completely—to hold fast and refuse division</a>. In the symbolic sense, it is the merging of your conscious awareness <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">("man")</a> with your chosen state <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">("wife")</a> until they become one living expression ("one flesh").</p>
<p>Paul’s insistence that “nothing can separate us” is not mere comfort—it is a powerful declaration of this same spiritual law. Once you cleave to a state in imagination, no circumstance, no depth of emotion, no outer condition can truly divide you from it. You have become one with it in love.</p>
<p>When you fall in love with a state of being and give yourself to it—gently, faithfully, and without panic—you find that the world itself begins to mirror that love back to you.</p>
<p>Not through force, but through the magnetic stillness of faithful imagination.</p>
<p>This is the beauty:<br />
That nothing—not time, nor thought, nor depth of feeling—can remove you from the love that is always present, when you dare to cleave to your desired state as your own living reality.</p>
