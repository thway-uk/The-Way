Scarlet marks a claim, a deliberate assumption, a chosen identity that brings forth a new reality.<p></p><hr /><h3>Scarlet: The Imaginative Force in Action</h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, imagination is the only creative power. When you're imagining—whether in love or fear, faith or doubt—you are assuming. You are wearing scarlet. And in this light, scarlet becomes not a symbol of guilt or shame, but a vivid sign that you have been imagining, that the creative force is active.</p><hr /><h3>Levitical Purification Rituals (Leviticus 14)</h3><p>The scarlet wool used in purification rituals represents the active assumption of cleansing and wholeness. Just as the priest physically applies the scarlet thread, the individual must imagine and assume their state as pure and whole, regardless of current appearances. The ritual’s external act mirrors the inner creative act — your imagination dyes your consciousness with the colour of your assumed reality. Scarlet here is the power of deliberate, repeated assumption to “cleanse” the self of limiting beliefs and manifest a new reality.</p><hr /><h3>Isaiah 1:18 – “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow…”</h3><p>This verse is often read as a promise of divine forgiveness—but through Neville Goddard’s understanding, we see something far more intimate and transformative. Neville defined sin not as moral failure, but as missing the mark—dwelling in an unlovely assumption, imagining from fear, separation, or lack.</p><p>Scarlet, then, represents the vivid use of imagination—impressed again and again until it dyes the fabric of consciousness. To be clothed in scarlet is to have assumed something intensely, even if unconsciously. But the verse promises transformation: what was once vividly imagined in error can be reimagined in truth.</p><p>Although you've been imagining the wrong thing (‘your sins are like scarlet’), you will come to imagine you never did.</p><p>This is not forgiveness from outside—it is revision from within. The scarlet thread of imagination is never the enemy; it is the power. What matters is what state it’s colouring.</p><hr /><h3>“Your lips are like a thread of scarlet…” – Song of Solomon 4:3</h3><p>In this poetic verse, the beloved’s lips are compared to a thread of scarlet. Lips are where speech originates—where assumption is verbalised. Neville frequently emphasised that inner speech determines outer reality. The red thread here symbolises the power of word: consciously chosen affirmations, lovingly spoken assumptions. The phrase “your mouth is lovely” suggests the fruitfulness of aligned inner dialogue.</p><p><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> The scarlet lips signify assumptions spoken in love and conviction, aligning perfectly with his teaching:<br />
<em>“Dare to assume that you are what you want to be and you will compel the world to conform to your assumption.”</em></p><hr /><h3>The Birth of Perez – Genesis 38:28–30</h3><p>Perez's twin brother, Zerah, first puts out his hand, and the midwife ties a scarlet thread around it, declaring he came out first. But Perez (“breakthrough”) pushes past and is born instead. The scarlet thread marks the expected, but the outcome is overtaken by the one who breaks through.</p><p><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> The scarlet thread here could represent an assumed outcome, the one expected according to appearances. Yet, true manifestation breaks through assumptions not deeply impressed or believed. Perez represents the power of radical assumption, of belief so strong it overrides external signs.</p><p>This scene illustrates the necessity of persisting in the assumption of your desired state—even when the “scarlet” (what appears likely) is not on you. Faith in the unseen overrules the visible mark.</p><hr /><h3>Rahab’s Scarlet Cord – Joshua 2:18, 6:25</h3><p>Rahab is instructed to hang a scarlet cord from her window as a sign to spare her and her family during the fall of Jericho. Her house is literally marked out by this colour.</p><p><strong>Neville Connection:</strong> The scarlet cord is an outward expression of an inner assumption. Rahab believed in the power of the Israelite God and aligned herself with the unfolding of divine destiny. She acted in faith, not just in fear—placing her assumption visibly before the world. The scarlet thread becomes a banner of <em>I AM saved, I AM included,</em> even before destruction begins.</p><p>This is a perfect expression of the Law of Assumption: she assumed her safety and place in the story, and it was fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3>Scarlet as Symbol of Chosen Identity</h3><p>Throughout the Bible, scarlet often appears in priestly garments, temple veils, and sacrifices. It’s the colour of blood, of boldness, of committed visibility. Spiritually, it may be interpreted through Neville’s teachings as:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A fixed assumption:</strong> A claim of identity that is deliberately impressed upon consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility of belief:</strong> That which marks one’s alignment with the divine pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power in speech:</strong> The spoken word, as in the scarlet lips, becomes the creative act.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Closing Thought: The Thread You Choose to Wear</h3><p>Just as scarlet threads through these pivotal moments—marking who is chosen, who breaks through, who is saved—you too wear your assumptions like garments. Neville said, <em>“You must dare to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</em> In other words, you must clothe yourself in scarlet—in the belief of your becoming.</p>
