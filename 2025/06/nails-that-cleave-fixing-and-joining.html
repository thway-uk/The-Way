<h1>Nails That Cleave: Fixing and Joining</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Foundational Symbol: Genesis 2:24</h3><p>The entire mystery of creation is captured in one early verse:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</strong><br />
<em>Genesis 2:24</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse symbolises more than human <a href="/search/label/Marriage%20Series">marriage</a>. In mystical interpretation, this “<a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">cleaving</a>” is the act of psychologically <i><b>nailing</b></i> an idea so completely in feeling that it must <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">express outwardly</a>. The same union reappears throughout the Bible, most vividly in the crucifixion.</p><hr /><h2>Crucifixion: Beyond Suffering</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus is often seen as a moment of suffering and sacrifice. Yet when interpreted mystically — especially through Neville Goddard’s teachings — it reveals a secret. In this light, the nails are not symbols of torture but keys to understanding how imagination <strong>fixes</strong> inner assumptions into reality.</p><hr /><h2>The Silent Nails: A Mystical Hint</h2><p>All four Gospels describe the crucifixion briefly and without detail:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"They crucified him."</strong><br />
— Matthew 27:35, Mark 15:25, Luke 23:33, John 19:18</p>
</blockquote><p>The nails receive no focus until after the resurrection. When the risen Jesus appears to Thomas, he invites him to touch the nail prints:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails… I will not believe."</strong><br />
— John 20:25</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the nails are not instruments of death but symbols — evidence that an <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">inner agreement has fixed all aspects of mind in harmony</a>, making the assumption real in consciousness.</p><hr /><h2>Neville Goddard: Fixation as Crucifixion</h2><p>Neville taught that <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucifixion</a> symbolises the fixation of consciousness. To "<a href="/2025/07/the-mark-of-beast-cains-mark-and-jesus.html">nail yourself to the cross</a>" is to hold <strong>unwaveringly to an assumption</strong>, regardless of external evidence.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Your ‘<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>’ — your awareness of being — is the God that was crucified with nails (fixed) on the idea or concept of what you want to be.”</strong><br />
— Neville Goddard, <em>Your Faith is Your Fortune</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When you refuse to abandon your chosen state, you crucify your awareness upon it. This is not suffering but disciplined faith, the sacred act of <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html"><strong>joining</strong> imagination and reality</a> — the very union first spoken of in Genesis 2:24.</p><hr /><h2>YHVH: The Divine Structure of Manifestation</h2><p>In the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet , a symbolic pattern the Bible uses to structure its narrative</a>, the name — <strong>YHVH (יהוה)</strong> — encodes the formula of creation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Yod</a> (י)</strong> — The seed of intention or desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">He</a> (ה)</strong> — The mental window or the picturing wind: subconscious conception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Vav</a> (ו)</strong> — The nail: the fixing of idea to feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">He</a> (ה)</strong> — Window again, but this time the results seen with the physical eye. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Vav, the nail, is the essential link between inner desire and outer expression. Without Vav, the spark cannot pass into form. With Vav, the imagined state is secured, guaranteeing its appearance in experience — again mirroring Genesis 2:24’s union of “one flesh.”</p><hr /><h2>Two Windows Nailed Together</h2><p>The repetition of He in YHVH represents two "windows" or perspectives:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The first He: inner vision — your imaginative perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second He: outer manifestation — the world you see.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Vav joins and <i><a href="htt/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">cleaves</a></i> these two, fusing inner and outer worlds into one seamless experience.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"All things exist in the human imagination, and everything you behold, though it appears without, it is within, in your imagination."</strong><br />
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2>The Lovers Tarot Card: The Sacred Marriage</h2><p>Although the framework is based on a different interpretation, The Lovers tarot card illustrates the sacred mental marriage: conscious mind (man), responsive mind (woman), and higher self (angel).</p><hr /><h2>Biblical Symbolism of Nailing</h2><p>In Ezra 9:8, we read:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"…to give us a nail in his holy place."</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>The "nail" represents a secure divine anchor — the fixing of spirit into the material world. This echoes Neville’s teaching: by fixing your assumption, you establish it as reality.</p><hr /><h2>Woman from Man: Genesis 2:23–24</h2><p>Genesis 2:23 describes <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman coming from man’s side</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This passage symbolises the subconscious <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">(woman)</a> emerging from the conscious <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">(man)</a>. In Genesis 2:24, man “<a href="/2025/06/the-bibles-golden-thread-union-with-new.html">cleaves</a>” (<i>nails together</i>) to his wife, and they become “one flesh” — a direct echo of Vav’s role as the nail, fusing the two into a living creation.</p><hr /><h2>Crucifixion as Mystical Mechanics</h2><p>The crucifixion is the final sealing of this union. The nails represent the fixing of the imaginative act into a <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">new self-concept</a>, the "<a href="/search/label/Marriage%20Series">marriage</a>" of idea and feeling. Once fixed, resurrection — the emergence of the new state — is inevitable.</p><p>When <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> shows the nail marks to Thomas, he reveals the physical proof of a spiritual law: what you fix in consciousness must manifest in form.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion: The Power of Vav</h2><p>The Hebrew alphabet, especially as revealed in the Mathers table, encodes the secret of creation. Vav — the nail — is at the heart of this mystery.</p><p>To manifest:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Yod:</strong> Choose the desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He:</strong> Feel it as real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav:</strong> Fix it through unwavering assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He:</strong> Witness it unfold in the outer world.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The nail is not mere symbolism — it is the living bridge between the unseen and the seen. From Genesis 2:24’s “one flesh” to the cross, the message is the same:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Creation is an inner union.<br />
Fix your assumption, and it will be.</strong></p></blockquote>
