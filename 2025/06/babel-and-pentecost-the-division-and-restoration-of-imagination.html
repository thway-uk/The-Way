<h1>Babel and Pentecost: The Division and Restoration of Imagination</h1>
<p><strong>A Neville Goddard Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>The Bible is not a record of historical events, but a psychological drama unfolding in the mind of every individual. When read with spiritual discernment, the Tower of Babel and the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost are not opposing miracles—but parallel scenes showing the descent and ascent of consciousness. One depicts the division of imagination. The other, its restoration.</p>
<h3><strong>Babel: The Fractured Mind</strong></h3>
<p><em>“And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech...”</em><br />
—Genesis 11:1</p>
<p>In the beginning, man was of one speech—meaning one assumption, one awareness, one creative power functioning harmoniously. The “earth” represents the subconscious, the emotional depth where creation takes root. To say the whole earth was of one language is to say that the creative faculties were unified.</p>
<p>But the moment man turned outward—to build a tower “whose top may reach unto heaven”—he fell into the error of separation. Heaven is not reached by outer structures or linear striving. It is within. When man tries to ascend through the outer world—through action divorced from imagination—confusion enters.</p>
<p><em>“Let us go down, and there confound their language...”</em><br />
—Genesis 11:7</p>
<p>To confound the language is to fragment the imagination. Thought is no longer clear. Desire and belief do not match. The inner speech begins to war against itself: one moment affirming, the next moment doubting. The tower collapses because it was built on a mind divided.</p>
<p>Babel is not a city in the Middle East. It is the internal state of anyone who attempts to build a life through action while ignoring the creative centre—<strong>I AM</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Pentecost: The Unification of the Word</strong></h3>
<p><em>“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.”</em><br />
—Acts 2:4</p>
<p>At Pentecost, the Spirit descends not into a temple made with hands, but into the awakened imagination. The “tongues of fire” are not foreign languages, but divine utterances from within. This is not a return to one literal language—but to one universal faculty: <strong>the creative assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>They all spoke, and yet all understood. In Babel, man was of one tongue but lost unity. In Acts, man appears to speak in many tongues, yet is restored to oneness. Why? Because all speech in this context is rooted in <strong>imaginative assumption</strong>. It is not the words that unify—it is the consciousness from which they arise.</p>
<p>Neville taught that assumption hardens into fact. When imagination is possessed by the Spirit—when man believes himself to be what he desires to be—then all inner speech becomes creative, constructive, and coherent. This is the restoration of the lost Word.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Tower Falls, the Temple Rises</strong></h3>
<p>In Babel, man is building a tower to reach what he believes is above him. At Pentecost, the Spirit makes it clear: the power is not above, but <strong>within</strong>.</p>
<p>To “speak in tongues” is to assume the state desired so vividly, so faithfully, that the subconscious hears only one voice. There is no confusion in imagination that is mastered. The old scattered voices of doubt and delay are silenced. The Word becomes flesh.</p>
<p>Neville would say that Pentecost is the moment when man stops seeking, and starts creating—<em>not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit within.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Inner Reversal</strong></h3>
<p>Babel represents the fall into duality—into the belief that man is separate from God, and that heaven must be reached. Pentecost is its reversal. It is not a new event, but a return to the eternal truth: <strong>I AM</strong> is the one language of creation.</p>
<p>When the Spirit descends—when you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled—every part of your being begins to speak the same thing. That is the true miracle: unity of inner speech. And when imagination is unified, nothing shall be restrained from you, which you have imagined to do.</p>
