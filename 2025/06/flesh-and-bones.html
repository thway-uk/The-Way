<h1>Flesh and Bones</h1>
<p>In the Bible, the phrase <em>“flesh and bone”</em> often appears in moments of recognition, union, and embodiment. When Adam sees Eve for the first time, he declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.”</em> – Genesis 2:23</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't just poetic language—it’s a symbol of internal substance becoming visible. In Neville Goddard’s teaching, this moment reflects a metaphysical truth: what we accept inwardly will take on outer form. Flesh and bones symbolise the <strong>solidification of imagination into experience</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Flesh = External Reality</strong></h3>
<p>Flesh, in biblical symbolism, represents the seen—the physical, outer world. Neville taught that everything in the flesh is simply a reflection of what has already been assumed in consciousness. What you believe and feel as true will eventually appear in the flesh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You become what you contemplate.” – Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Bones = Structure of Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Bones symbolise the <strong>framework</strong>—the belief structure that supports what appears as life. Just as bones give form to the body, assumptions give form to experience. When Eve is said to be “bone of Adam’s bones,” it symbolises that she arises from his own internal world—his imagination. The story about <a href="/2025/04/the-valley-of-dry-bones-awakening-power.html">Ezekiel and the valley of dry bones</a> demonstrates this symbolism.</p>
<h3><strong>Manifestation Is Recognition</strong></h3>
<p>The phrase “flesh of my flesh” is a declaration of inner union becoming outer reality. In Neville’s terms, it’s when your desire—once assumed and felt—becomes so real, you meet it in the world and recognise: <em>this is mine, this came from me.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>In Essence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bones</strong> = The inner assumption (structure)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flesh</strong> = The outer manifestation (form)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, they symbolise your desire made real—<em>what you imagined, now embodied.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible and the Law of Assumption speak with one voice: <em>your world is your reflected self—flesh and bone from the frame of your imagination.</em></p>
