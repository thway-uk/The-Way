<h1>Everyone’s God: The World’s Assumptions vs. the Truth of “I AM”</h1>
<p>It’s easy to put the world on a pedestal—to look around at the voices of society, the traditions we’re born into, the inherited <a href="/search/label/Reasons%20to%20Avoid%20the%20Literal%20Bible">doctrines and dogmas</a>—and assume that <em>they</em> must know something we don’t. We grow up surrounded by a thousand versions of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>: each culture, household, and denomination offering its own interpretation. Each person, consciously or unconsciously, trying to give shape to something they feel but cannot quite articulate.</p><p>Comedian Ricky Gervais once put it bluntly:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"There have been nearly 3000 Gods so far, but only yours actually exists. The others are silly made-up nonsense. But not yours. Yours is real."</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>It’s a scathing but revealing observation. Most people don’t question the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">image</a> of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> they inherit—they simply assume it. Whether it’s the angry deity of childhood fear, the distant figure of religious ritual, or the comforting idol of culture and creed, these gods are often projections—assumptions absorbed from the world around us.</p><p>And this is precisely where the Bible, when read symbolically, opens up a deeper truth.</p><p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a history book, but a story about <em>you</em>. Every character is a state of consciousness. Every event is a symbolic unfolding of inner awareness. And the law it reveals is the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>—that what you assume to be true of yourself, you begin to express and experience.</p><p>So when society defines <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> as distant, wrathful, or conditional, it's merely reflecting its own assumed distance, anger, and self-judgement. Each person, knowingly or not, lives out their idea of God—because <em>your concept of God is your concept of self</em>. When you say, “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> not worthy,” you are declaring the nature of your God. When you say, “I AM loved, I AM powerful, I AM,” you are touching the truth.</p><p>The Bible begins with <em>I AM</em>:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And God said to Moses, ‘<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>’” (Exodus 3:14, BBE).</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a cryptic riddle but a profound key. “I AM” is the name of God, and it is the beginning of every self-concept. The law of Assumption teaches that whatever follows “I am” becomes your world. The creative power of the universe is in what you assume to be true—about yourself, about life, about what is possible.</p><p>And this brings us to a quiet revolution: stop assuming the world is right about God. Stop believing that truth lives outside of you, in someone else’s theology or tradition. Instead, begin to realise that <em>you</em> are the living temple, and the God you’ve been searching for has been whispering “I am” all along.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?”<br />
(1 Corinthians 3:16, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Everyone is trying to define something they can feel but haven’t dared to identify: <em>the power of assumption within</em>. And it is not wrong to name that power “God.” But it is fatal to assume it is <em>outside of you</em>.</p>
