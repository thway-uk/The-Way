<h1>Fish and Imagination: Jesus’ Miracles Through the Law of Assumption</h1>
<p>In the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table</a>, the Hebrew letter <strong>Nun (נ)</strong>—literally meaning “fish”—symbolises hidden movement, transformation, and the unseen workings of imagination within the subconscious. In the New Testament, Jesus enacts the 'Spirit moving over the face of the waters' (Genesis 1:2). His interactions with fish and <a href="/search/label/Water%20Symbolism">water</a> are not literal events, but symbolic parables: allegories of assumption, showing how inner states emerge into visible form. Read psychologically, these stories teach us to “fish” for our desires—gestating them beneath the surface until they break through into reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>1. “Follow Me, and I Will Make You Fishers of Men”</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Matthew 4:19; Mark 1:17)</em></p>
<p>When Jesus calls Peter and Andrew, he offers more than a career change. He invites them into a new way of being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface meaning:</strong> Become evangelists, gathering souls for the kingdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imaginative meaning:</strong> Learn to “fish” with consciousness—casting the net of your assumption into the subconscious waters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Assumption:</strong> You become what you imagine yourself to be - this is '<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a>'. By following the inner Christ (your own imaginative faculty), you draw into your life experiences that mirror your assumed identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. The Miraculous Catch</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Luke 5:1–11; John 21:1–14)</em></p>
<p><strong>a. The Overwhelming Haul</strong><br />
After an unsuccessful night, Simon lowers his nets again at Jesus’ word and pulls in more fish than he can manage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface meaning:</strong> A miraculous provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imaginative meaning:</strong> Even when our efforts (the “night”) seem barren, a simple, faith-filled assumption (“Let down the net”) unlocks abundance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden movement (Nun):</strong> Subconscious belief has been working unseen. The sudden catch is the fish of assumption surfacing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. Breakfast by the Sea</strong><br />
Post-resurrection, Jesus tells the disciples to cast on the right side. They haul in exactly 153 large fish.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface meaning:</strong> Confirmation of the risen Christ’s reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imaginative meaning:</strong> The “right side” signifies correct assumption. The precise number (153) symbolises completeness—full restoration of the assumed state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nun in action:</strong> What was hidden in the depths of belief emerges fully formed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Feeding the Five Thousand</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Matthew 14:13–21; John 6:1–14)</em></p>
<p>With just five loaves and two fish, Jesus feeds a multitude—and gathers twelve baskets of leftovers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface meaning:</strong> Supernatural multiplication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbolic numbers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Five (He, ה):</strong> “Window,” The window is a metaphor for imagination, the breath of Spirit into form—the moment you glimpse the fulfilled desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two fish (Nun):</strong> Union of conscious and subconscious assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law of Assumption:</strong> Combine your vision (five loaves) with your hidden belief (fish), and your outer world (the crowd) will be satisfied—more than enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. The Coin in the Fish’s Mouth</strong></h3>
<p><em>(Matthew 17:24–27)</em></p>
<p>To pay the temple tax, Jesus instructs Peter to catch a fish; inside its mouth is the exact coin needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface meaning:</strong> A discreet miracle to avoid offence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imaginative meaning:</strong> Your subconscious contains every resource you require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical application:</strong> Cast the net of expectancy—assume provision—and the means will surface without struggle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. Fishing with the Letter Nun</strong></h3>
<p>Recalling our exploration of <strong>Nun (50)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fifty (Nun):</strong> The hidden gestation of assumption across forty-nine moments culminates in the fiftieth breakthrough—your subconscious delivers the assumed state into experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fish imagery:</strong> Like a fish beneath the water, your desire swims unseen until the appointed moment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Practical Steps to Fish with Imagination</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cast the Net of Vision</strong><br />
Picture your desire clearly—your “net”—and feel its reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breathe through the Window (He, 5)</strong><br />
Inhale the conviction of fulfilment. Let that breath sustain your belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust the Silent Work (Nun, 50)</strong><br />
Know that your assumption moves beneath awareness. Avoid doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gather the Catch</strong><br />
Notice every small confirmation. Collect them until your inner and outer worlds harmonise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Jesus’ fish stories are invitations to master your imagination. From the call to “become fishers of men,” through miraculous hauls and multiplied meals, to the coin in the fish’s mouth, each scene reveals how assumption—like a fish moving beneath the surface—breaks through into manifestation. Embrace the Law of Assumption: cast your nets, trust the depths, and watch your desires swim into the light.</p>
