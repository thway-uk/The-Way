<h1>Seventy Times Seven: Continual Forgiveness</h1>
<p>When most people hear <strong>"<a href="/2025/04/repentance-from-guilt-to-imagination.html">forgive</a> seventy times seven,"</strong> they imagine a moral command to endlessly pardon others. But according to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a book of ethics — it is a psychological manual showing you how to shape your reality through <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assumption</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Who Is the "Brother"?</h2><p>In Matthew 18, Peter asks:</p><blockquote>
<p>"Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"</p>
</blockquote><p>Psychologically, <strong>"your brother"</strong> is not an external person. It represents the old, limiting states within yourself — the persistent thoughts, doubts, and feelings that contradict your chosen desire.</p><p>Each time a contradictory state arises, you are invited to "<a href="/2025/04/repentance-from-guilt-to-imagination.html">forgive</a>" it — meaning you release it and return to your wish fulfilled. This is beautifully illustrated in the <a href="/2025/05/joseph-and-power-of-assumption-neville.html">story of Joseph</a>, who rises in consciousness despite being rejected by his brothers.</p><hr /><h2>The Numbers: 7 and 70</h2><p><a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a> replies:</p><blockquote>
<p>"I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."</p>
</blockquote><p>In <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew symbolism</a>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>7</strong> signifies spiritual perfection and completion (as in the seven days of creation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>70</strong> represents a full spiritual cycle or complete order (such as the 70 elders of Israel or the 70 nations).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In esoteric correspondences (like the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table</a>), 70 symbolises totality or wholeness. When multiplied — <strong>seventy times seven</strong> — it speaks to <strong>perfect, unending completion</strong>, urging you to persist until your inner work is finished and solidified in the outer world.</p><hr /><h2>The Contrast: Lamech’s Vengeance</h2><p>Long before Jesus, Genesis tells of Lamech:</p><blockquote>
<p>"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold." (Genesis 4:24)</p>
</blockquote><p>Lamech represents a <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">vengeful, reactive state</a> — the old man of reaction and conflict. He uses the same numerical structure to declare endless vengeance, a devotion to reinforcing old <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">wounds</a> and perpetuating the past.</p><p><a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> transforms this symbol completely. Where Lamech insists on vengeance without end, Jesus teaches <strong><a href="/2025/04/repentance-from-guilt-to-imagination.html">forgiveness</a> without end</strong> — the continual return to your chosen state, regardless of how many times the old self reappears.</p><hr /><h2>Forgiveness as Inner Realignment</h2><p>For Neville, forgiveness isn’t about condoning others’ actions. It is the art of <strong>abandoning any thought that denies your assumption</strong> and faithfully returning to your ideal.</p><p>Each time an old belief or feeling arises, you "forgive" it by letting it go and reaffirming your desired state. This is not moral virtue — it is <strong>psychological mastery</strong>.</p><hr /><h2>Another Symbolic Tie-In: Jacob Wrestling the Angel</h2><p>The story of <a href="/2025/05/jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html" style="font-weight: bold;">Jacob wrestling</a><b> with the angel </b><i>(or man depending on translation, either way, both represent grappling with the new self) </i>(Genesis 32) powerfully echoes this idea. Jacob refuses to let go until he receives a blessing, symbolising the same inner persistence: the unwavering refusal to let go of your <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">chosen assumption</a> until it transforms your identity ("Israel") and becomes reality.</p><hr /><h2>The Deeper Message</h2><p>"Seventy times seven" is not a demand, but an <strong>inner law of creation</strong>. It calls you to perfect your inner world through constant, faithful assumption — to forgive every opposing thought, persist beyond all resistance, and remain loyal to your ideal until it hardens into fact.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Forgiveness is not moral pardon. It is the continual act of returning to your chosen state, seventy times seven, until your imagined world becomes your lived world."</em></p>
