<h1>Paul: Ungodliness</h1>
<p><b>Romans 1:18–23</b> is often read as a grim indictment of moral failure. But through the eyes of Neville Goddard, the passage reveals something deeper: the tragedy of forgetting that God is within—that your imagination is the creative power of the universe. Paul’s words, when understood symbolically, trace the inner descent of <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">consciousness—from the clarity of knowing “<b><i>I AM</i></b></a>” (Exodus 3:14) to the confusion and darkness that follows when we misuse or neglect assumption. This post rightly interprets these verses as a warning against turning away from imagination, and a reminder that all transformation begins within.</p>

<h2><strong>Romans 1:18 (KJV)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">men</a>, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrath of God</strong> is <strong>not emotional anger</strong>, but the <strong>automatic outpicturing of misused imagination</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Revealed from heaven" means this consequence unfolds from the <strong>higher realms of consciousness (heaven = awareness)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who “hold the truth in <a href="/2025/05/judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">unrighteousness</a>” symbolise <strong>states of being where one knows the truth of imagination but continues to misuse it</strong>, imagining harm, limitation, or fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Ungodliness” = not acknowledging that <strong>“I AM” is God</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Unrighteousness” = not being in right alignment with the <strong>assumption of the ideal state</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Romans 1:19</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everyone has within them the ability to know <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html"><strong>God as their own I AM</strong>—their own imagination</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Manifest in them” is key: the divine truth is <strong>within</strong>, not external.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neville often said, <em>“God became man that man may become God.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This verse echoes that: <strong>all are aware deep within that imagination creates reality</strong>, but many ignore it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Romans 1:20</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>outer world (“things that are made”)</strong> reveals the inner invisible patterns of belief and assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We understand <strong>invisible consciousness</strong> by looking at <strong>visible results</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is central to the Law of Assumption: <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html"><strong>outer reality is a mirror of inner belief</strong>. This is the seed in itself.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Without excuse” means that once we become aware of this law, we cannot blame the world—<strong>we must change within</strong> to change without.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Romans 1:21</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Knew God” = <strong>recognised imagination as the creative power</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Glorified him not” = <strong>refused to honour their imagination</strong>, using it for fear, doubt, or passivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Neither were thankful” = a failure to live in the <strong>end state with gratitude</strong>, a key technique Neville taught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Vain in their imaginations” = <strong>empty, idle, or negative use of imagination</strong>—imagining what is unwanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Foolish heart was darkened” = the subconscious (heart) becomes clouded with limiting beliefs and emotions, no longer aligned with truth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Romans 1:22</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Those who rely only on intellectual logic or religious tradition without inner transformation <strong>mistake outer knowledge for true wisdom</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Wisdom” is the <strong>applied use of imagination</strong> in alignment with the desired state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Fools” are those who <strong>deny the creative power of assumption</strong>, or misuse it, then wonder why their world is in chaos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Romans 1:23</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Neville Interpretation</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is the <strong>turning away from awareness of God-as-consciousness</strong>, and projecting power onto <strong>outer forms</strong>—whether religious icons, systems, or nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Corruptible man” = the <strong>ego</strong>, the outer self, which is <strong>always changing</strong> and vulnerable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Birds… beasts… creeping things” = the <strong>lower levels of consciousness</strong>, instinctual and reactive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a warning against idolising the <strong>seen world</strong> and forgetting the <strong>invisible power within</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neville would say: <strong>the only true image of God is your own imagination</strong>—<em>“God is your own wonderful human imagination.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Summary (Neville’s Perspective on Romans 1:18–23):</strong></h2>
<p>This passage becomes a warning against the misuse or neglect of imagination. Paul symbolically describes the <strong>fall from conscious creation into reactive living</strong>. When man forgets that <strong>his I AM is God</strong>, he begins to <strong>worship external forms</strong>, blame others, or misuse thought. The result is a darkened heart and a distorted life experience.</p>
<p><strong>Right use of imagination</strong>, giving thanks, living from the end, honouring your assumptions—these restore alignment with God (your true self). The “wrath” is not a divine punishment, but <strong>the natural outpicturing of unlovely assumptions</strong>.</p>
