<hr />
<p><strong>The Bible is not a record of ancient history, but a map of the soul.</strong><br />
When approached symbolically — as Neville Goddard taught — it reveals not external events, but inner movements. It chronicles the unfoldment of consciousness: the interplay of belief, resistance, submission, and transformation within the individual.</p>
<p>This exploration follows a subtle thread woven through the <strong>sheep imagery in Scripture</strong>: Nabal and Judah during sheep-shearing, and the prophetic words from <em>Isaiah 53</em>, echoed in <em>Acts 8</em> —</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, these moments may seem unrelated. But under the law of the subject — that all is within, and every character is a state of consciousness — they form a coherent and revelatory pattern.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Beyond Flocks and Feasts: What Is Truly Sheared?</h2>
<p>We are invited to look past the surface of flocks and feasts, beyond the silence of the lamb, to see what is really being sheared:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>old man</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>outdated belief</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>hardened ego</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each story reveals what happens when the <strong>subconscious is laid bare</strong> — whether it yields foolishness and decay, or new life and breakthrough.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. The Sheep as Symbol: The Submissive Subconscious</h2>
<p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>sheep represent the submissive nature of the subconscious</strong> — docile, compliant, led by the dominant state (the shepherd or conscious direction).</p>
<p>When Neville says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Man is all imagination, and God is man and exists in us and we in Him,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he places the authority of reality in the <strong>imaginal act</strong>. The “sheep” are impressions, assumptions, or accepted beliefs that become incarnate, often without protest — just as sheep do not resist shearing or slaughter.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Shearing Sheep: <em>Nabal and Judah</em></h2>
<p>Judah (Genesis 38:12–13) and Nabal (1 Samuel 25) are both described during sheep-shearing time. This is no coincidence — it is <strong>highly symbolic</strong>.</p>
<h3>Sheep-shearing in the Bible typically signals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>moment of reckoning or exposure</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harvest of subconscious fruit</strong> (manifestation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>turning point in state</strong> — either <strong>decay</strong> (Nabal) or <strong>regeneration</strong> (Judah moving into the Messiah’s lineage via Tamar)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Neville-wise interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nabal’s sheep-shearing feast:</strong><br />
He refuses David’s request, symbolising the refusal to recognise the new, anointed state of being (David).<br />
<em>Nabal</em> means “fool” — he represents the egoic, hardened state that rejects the imaginal seed.<br />
His “heart dies within him” when he finally perceives what he rejected — symbolising the old man collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah’s sheep-shearing:</strong><br />
Leads to his union with Tamar, disguised as a harlot — representing a hidden desire or subconscious condition breaking through, bringing about <em>Perez</em> ("breakthrough").<br />
This is the moment when <strong>praise (Judah)</strong>  initiates the birth of new awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sheep-shearing is the stripping away of coverings, the subconscious yielding what has been planted — foolishly or wisely.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>3. “Led as a Sheep to the Slaughter” (Isaiah 53 / Acts 8)</h2>
<p>This is the most poignant sheep image, appearing in the Ethiopian eunuch’s reading just before his baptism — a moment of personal transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearers is silent...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville interprets Jesus as the <strong>personification of the awakened imagination</strong>. This verse becomes a psychological portrait of the moment imagination consents to the crucifixion — being fixed in a belief or assumption in silence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“He opened not his mouth”</strong> = Acceptance. The imaginal act is planted quietly, without arguing against the senses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“In his humiliation his justice was taken away”</strong> = The external world misunderstands the imaginative act; justice belongs to the inner seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Who shall declare his generation?”</strong> = Imagination’s offspring is unknown until it appears in reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“For his life is taken from the earth”</strong> = Withdrawal from outer appearances, so the seed can germinate within.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This mirrors Neville’s teaching on <em>dying to the old man</em>: the assumption must be accepted inwardly as true, without arguing against appearances. You rest in acceptance that imagination creates reality.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Bringing It Together: The Law of the Subject</h2>
<p>Neville’s law teaches you are always the <strong>operant power</strong>. Everyone in the Bible — from Judah to Nabal to the suffering servant — represents <strong>subjective states within you</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nabal</strong> = The foolish ego, clinging to external safety, refusing to share or accept the new imaginal potential (David), losing his life in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah</strong> = Praise; in the sheep-shearing story, he initiates a symbolic shift. His encounter with Tamar shows praise bringing breakthrough (<em>Perez</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The silent lamb</strong> = Imagination in full submission; it does not argue or defend but assumes and dies to the old.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Neville Goddard Quote to Underscore the Theme:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dare to assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue therein. For the assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “sheep to the slaughter” is that assumption dying to what it appears to be — silent before facts — sheared (exposed, humiliated, misunderstood) before it resurrects.</p></div>
