<h1>The Dove in the Rock: Paul, Jesus and Cephas</h1>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.” – John 1:42 (KJV)</strong></blockquote><p></p><p>This moment may appear simple on the surface - Jesus renaming a man. But when we understand the Bible as Neville Goddard did, as a psychological document rather than a historical account — this single verse opens into a powerful sequence of inner transformation.</p><p>Simon means <strong>“he who hears.”</strong> He is the faculty within us that listens, receives, and contemplates. The son of <em>Jona</em>, meaning “dove,” hints at the <strong>spiritual or subconscious dimension</strong> from which this hearing emerges. But Jesus, the symbol of awakened imagination — looks at Simon and <strong>calls him by his potential</strong>, not his present state.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Thou shalt be called Cephas.”</strong></p>
<p>Cephas (Peter) means <strong>“a stone.”</strong> It is not passive hearing anymore — it is something <strong>fixed</strong>, something <strong>stable</strong>, something <strong>certain</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s teachings, this is the moment we move from <strong>passively hearing truth</strong> to <strong>living it as a firm assumption</strong>. You’ve heard the teaching — that imagination creates reality — and now you accept it deeply, to the point where it becomes a rock within you. This is not just about knowledge; it is about identity.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Cephas in Paul’s Letters: The Stabilised State</strong></h2><p>What’s particularly interesting is that <strong>Paul often refers to Cephas</strong> — not using the Greek "Peter" but retaining the Aramaic “Cephas,” meaning <em>stone</em>. This is psychologically symbolic, and when we read it through Neville Goddard’s framework, it makes perfect sense.</p><p>Paul’s letters are deeply psychological. He isn’t merely commenting on personalities or church politics — he’s outlining <strong>the dynamics of consciousness</strong>. So when he mentions Cephas, it’s not incidental. It’s a nod to a <strong>state of mind that has become fixed</strong> — a stabilised assumption. Paul is referencing, again and again, the power of something inwardly solidified.</p><p>Let’s explore what these mentions symbolise when viewed through the Law of Assumption:</p><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>1 Corinthians 1:12 — “I am of Cephas…”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“Every one of you saith, I am of Paul… I of Cephas…”</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, Paul critiques those dividing themselves by allegiance to personalities. But symbolically, this shows how we often <strong>fragment our own consciousness</strong>, aligning parts of our identity with outer authorities - intellect (Paul), eloquence (Apollos), or even stable assumption (Cephas).</p><p>Neville would remind us:</p><blockquote>
<p>“You are not of Cephas — Cephas is of you. These are <strong>your</strong> states. You are the operant power.”</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>1 Corinthians 3:22 — “All are yours.”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas… all are yours.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This is a profound affirmation that <strong>every state of consciousness is available to you.</strong> The teacher, the reasoning mind, and the stabilised assumption — all are tools of the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html" target="_blank">I AM</a>. You are not to be subject to them, but to operate them consciously. Cephas is yours to assume whenever you choose to <strong>stand firmly in your desire fulfilled.</strong></p><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>1 Corinthians 9:5 — “As Cephas…”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife… as Cephas?”</p>
</blockquote><p>Symbolically, this could speak to <strong>the union of conscious and subconscious</strong>. Neville often referred to the subconscious as feminine — receptive, nurturing. Cephas walking with his “wife” reflects the <strong>inner marriage</strong>, the agreement between the assumption and its felt realness. You can live in the world in complete harmony with your inner conviction.</p><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>Galatians 1:18 — “To see Cephas”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“After three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas…”</p>
</blockquote><p>Three years — a number of completion. Jerusalem — the city of peace, symbolic of <strong>manifested desire</strong>. Paul going to Cephas is the symbolic return to <strong>a stabilised assumption after a process of growth</strong>. You no longer just believe intellectually; the state has become a stone — unwavering and firm within.</p><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>Galatians 2:9 — “Pillars”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“James, Cephas, and John… who seemed to be pillars…”</p>
</blockquote><p>Here Paul names the inner pillars of spiritual structure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>James</strong> — symbolic of order and discipline of thought,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John</strong> — the beloved, representing emotion and feeling,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cephas</strong> — the stabilised assumption, the immovable foundation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, they uphold the inner temple of manifestation. Without a firm assumption (Cephas), nothing stands</p><hr /><h3>🪨 <strong>Galatians 2:11 — “I withstood Cephas…”</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>“But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face…”</p>
</blockquote><p>Even a stabilised assumption (Cephas) can falter. Paul (symbolising <strong>rational awareness</strong>) calls him out — perhaps when the inner conviction has wavered. Neville would call this a moment of <strong>double-mindedness</strong> when your assumption says one thing, but your behaviour or mood contradicts it.</p><blockquote>
<p>“You must assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and persist in it.”<br />
To waver is to delay manifestation.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>The Dove in the Cleft of the Rock</strong></h2><p>This deep relationship between <strong>the dove (Jona)</strong> and <strong>the rock (Cephas)</strong> appears again in the poetic and mystical language of the <strong>Song of Solomon 2:14 NKJV</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely”</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the <strong>dove</strong> — a recurring symbol of the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, peace, and hidden creative power — is found <strong>within the clefts of the rock</strong>, just as Simon (hearing) is the son of Jona (dove) and becomes the rock (Cephas). The <strong>“secret places of the stairs”</strong> represent those inner transitions of consciousness, the invisible shifts between states.</p><p>This verse poetically illustrates the very mechanics of the Law of Assumption:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>subconscious (dove)</strong> resides in the <strong>assumed state (rock)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voice and countenance longed for are the <strong>manifestations</strong> we wish to see and hear in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The call is for the <strong>unseen assumption to make itself visible</strong> — the stone to speak, the dove to emerge.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville taught that your assumption, once impressed upon the subconscious, works in <strong>secret</strong>, just like the dove in the cleft. But eventually, the voice is heard. The face appears. The desire becomes fact.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Simon Becomes Cephas in You</strong></h2><p>The Bible’s brilliance is that <strong>every character is a state</strong>, every name a symbolic doorway. Simon becoming Cephas is not just a disciple’s name change, it is <strong>the inner journey of every person who hears the truth of imagination</strong> and begins to live it.</p><p>Cephas represents the point where <strong>you no longer question your desire</strong>. You don’t negotiate with the facts. You don’t wait for proof. You stand, internally and unshakably, on the rock of “It is done.”</p><p>As Neville said:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Persist in your assumption. And your assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.</p></blockquote>
