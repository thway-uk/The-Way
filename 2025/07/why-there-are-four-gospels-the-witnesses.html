<h1>Why There Are Four Gospels: The Witnesses</h1>
<p>There are four Gospels in the New Testament—not because the life of Jesus required multiple accounts, but because each reveals a spiritual law in operation from a different angle. Together, they serve not only as biographies, but as <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">studied and embodied foundational qualities</a> that support the emergence of the Christ within man.</p><p>This demonstrative pattern was taught symbolically in the Old Testament through four central patriarchs: <strong><a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah</a></strong>. Each of these men stand as a <strong>teacher of how to live according to the Law of Assumption</strong> — the truth that <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a> becomes what he inwardly accepts and embodies.</p><p><a href="/search/label/Abraham%20Series"><b>Abraham</b></a> shows us what it means to believe in the unseen, and to leave behind attachments— to walk by assumption, not evidence.<br /><span><a href="/search/label/Jacob%20Series"><b>Jacob</b></a> demonstrates the inner wrestling required for transformation</span><strong>.</strong> His story is not simply one of persistence, but of contending with the self — the old identity — until a new one is formed</p><p><a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series"><b>Joseph</b></a> reveals the creative power of imagination — how the inner world, when faithfully occupied, shapes external reality.<br /><b><a href="/search/label/Judah%20Series">Judah</a></b> teaches the role of praise — the raising and lifting of Assumption towards oneself, and the inward celebration and affirmation of what is already assumed to be true.</p><p>These <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four figures <strong>teach the law by living it</strong></a>. Their stories aren’t just records of events; they are spiritual instructions encoded in narrative form. Each one represents a core faculty of the awakened soul — and together, they outline the full inner process by which man realises his divine nature.</p><p>When we arrive at the Gospels, we are not hearing something new, but something fulfilled. The <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four Gospels</a> exist because the Christ — the state of awakened “I AM” — is only brought forth when these four patriarchal qualities are active and aligned within. Each <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Gospel stands as a <strong>confirmation of what the patriarchs first revealed symbolically</strong></a>: that the path to divine identity is inward, structured, and knowable.</p><p>The New Testament echoes this necessity. “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established,” Paul writes (2 Corinthians 13:1). Here we are given four — a complete and harmonious witness. The presence of four Gospels confirms that the message of Christ is not arbitrary, but patterned — built on a foundation laid long before.</p><p>Even the <a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">prophetic imagery of Ezekiel</a> echoes this concept. His vision of four living creatures — each with four faces — reflects the completeness of spiritual being. Though mystical and dreamlike, it affirms the same reality: <strong>that full divine expression requires the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">integration of distinct faculties working together</a></strong>. What <a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">Ezekiel</a> saw in symbols, and what the patriarchs lived in story, the Gospels proclaim in direct witness.</p><p>The Gospels are not separate stories, but four unified confirmations of one inner event: the birth of the Christ in man. And that birth is not random or miraculous in the conventional sense. It is the natural result of enacting the law first modelled by <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah — teachers of faith, persistence, imagination, and praise.</a></p><p>These <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">four qualities</a> do not just support the Gospel message. They <em>are</em> the message — lived first in the shadows of the Old Testament, and then brought to full light in the life and words of Jesus. The Gospels confirm that what was once patterned is now fulfilled, and that the path to divine awareness lies not in imitation, but in inner transformation.</p>
