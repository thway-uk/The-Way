But to the one who sees with the eyes of imagination, as <a href="/2025/06/only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard</a> teaches, this is an unveiling of spiritual law. The verse is <b>not about anatomy or gender</b>, but about <strong><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">consciousness</a> and manifestation</strong>, the inner and outer aspects of your own creative power.<div><br /><div>The phrase “she shall be <i><b>called Woman</b></i>” here is more than a simple naming; it is a <b><i>calling forth</i></b>—a declaration of her essential function and destiny within consciousness. <a href="/search/label/Genesis%202%3A24%20Series">Woman</a> is called to be the receptive power, the creative womb within the mind that gives form to the desires <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">conceived by man</a>. She emerges not as a label but as a vital, active force of creation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as God declares “<b><a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM THAT I AM</a></b>” — Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh — in Exodus 3:14, meaning both “I will be what I will be” and “I AM that I AM,” we hear the same creative pattern echoed in Adam’s words: “<b><i>bone of my bones, and flesh of my fles</i>h</b>.” This is not just about origin, but about identity and expression. <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">“Woman” is what consciousness has <i>called</i> forth from itself—the <b>visible emergence of an invisible assumption</b></a>, manifestation as self made flesh.<br /><p></p>
<h3><strong>Man as Awareness, Woman as Embodiment </strong></h3>
<p></p><blockquote>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. - Genesis 3:20</blockquote><p></p><p>In Neville’s teaching, the <strong>“<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html" target="_blank">man</a>”</strong> symbolises your <strong>conscious awareness of being</strong>—that deep “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html" target="_blank">I AM</a>” from which all creation proceeds. The <strong>“woman,”</strong> drawn from man, symbolises the <strong>outer world</strong>, or any <strong>manifested condition</strong> in your life. She is not another being, but a reflection of the <strong>assumption you have internalised</strong>.</p>
<p>To say “bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh” is to declare: <em>This thing I now see or experience in the world was born from my own consciousness. It is not separate from me—it is of me. It is my inner state made visible.</em></p><p>Eve is described in Genesis 3:2 as the 'mother of all living', because from her emanates the world of the reader<em>.</em></p><p>The reference to '<a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">wife' is the beginning of marriage, bride and bridegroom symbolism</a>. This is the deliberate joining of conscious and imaginative aspects of mind.</p>
<h3><strong>The Crucifixion: Fixing the Idea in Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>This inner dynamic is echoed later in the story of Jesus. Neville explains that the <strong><a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series" target="_blank">crucifixion</a></strong> is not a historical event, but the moment when a desire or idea is <strong>fixed in imagination</strong>. The <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">“nailing” of Jesus to the cross represents the commitment to an assumption.</a></p>
<p>Once the state is fixed—“crucified”—it must be resurrected. It must rise into visibility. The outer world, like the <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">“woman” in Genesis, will take form from the seed of your inner conviction.</a></p>
<p>So, when Adam names the <a href="/search/label/Genesis%202%3A24%20Series">woman</a> and acknowledges her as “flesh of my flesh,” he is doing what you do when you recognise your own manifestion: owning it. <strong>Every outer circumstance is a "child" of your inner fixation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Birth of Isaac: Manifestation in Its Season</strong></h3>
<p>This process of inner conception and outer birth is also seen in the story of <strong>Isaac</strong>, born to Sarah after years of barrenness. Sarah represents the <strong>womb of the subconscious</strong>, and Isaac the long-awaited manifestation. Neville often quoted Paul: <em>“These things are an allegory”</em>—and indeed they are.</p>
<p><a href="/2025/04/the-birth-of-faith-abraham-as.html">Isaac’s birth</a> happens “in due season,” after the assumption is fully accepted and rests in faith. So too does the woman in Genesis appear after a deep sleep—a letting go—just as creation arises when you release the assumption into the subconscious and allow it to gestate.</p>
<h3><strong>Naming as a Creative Act</strong></h3>
<p>“She shall be <i>called</i> Woman…”—naming in Scripture is not just a labelling, but an <strong><a href="/p/genesis-1-creation.html">act of creation</a></strong>. To name is to claim. It is to say, “This is what I know it to be.” <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">The outer world responds to your inner naming</a>.</p>
<p>Neville said, <em>“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.”</em> The woman—your world, will always take her name from the state you dwell in.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Reflection</strong></h3>
<p>Genesis 2:23 is not an ancient biology lesson—it is a master key to understanding how the world you experience is <strong>your imagination externalised</strong>. The “woman” is every result, every condition, every encounter. She's your assumption made flesh. And whether the birth is immediate like Eve or delayed like Isaac, the law is the same: <strong>As within, so without.</strong></p>
<p>Every crucifixion (assumption fixed) leads to resurrection (manifestation revealed). You are both the Adam who imagines and the Eve who appears. You are always meeting yourself in form.</p>
