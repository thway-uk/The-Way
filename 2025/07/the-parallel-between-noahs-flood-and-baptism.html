<h1>The Parallel Between Noah's Flood and Baptism</h1>
<p>The Bible, when read through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, reveals itself not as a record of external events but as a psychological map for inner transformation. Central to this is the recurring symbol of water, first introduced in Genesis 1:2:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And the Spirit of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> moved upon the face of the waters.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><a href="/2025/05/the-symbolism-of-water-in-bible.html">Water</a> represents the formless, receptive subconscious mind — the vast deep from which all creation is born. Just as the Spirit moved upon the <a href="/search/label/Water%20Symbolism">waters</a> to bring forth light and order, so our imagination moves upon the subconscious to shape and give life to new states of being.</p><hr /><h2>The Flood: A Deluge of New Assumption</h2><p>In the story of Noah (Genesis 6–9), the flood is often seen as divine wrath and judgment. Yet, in Neville’s understanding, it symbolises a mental and spiritual cleansing — a flood of new assumptions washing away old, limiting beliefs.</p><p>Noah represents the unwavering aspect of mind that clings to a chosen state despite external evidence. His ark (container of the mind) is the new state of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> that rises above the chaotic waters of doubt and fear.</p><p>The flood is not about physical survival, but about the purification of thought, clearing the subconscious for the emergence of a new self. The need for purification of thought comes from the understanding of Genesis 4:4-7 <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">where sin is defined as failing to assume pleasurably</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Baptism: Entering the New State</h2><p>In the New Testament, baptism carries forward this <a href="/search/label/Water%20Symbolism">water symbolism</a>. Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:13–17) is not a mere ritual, but an act of stepping into a new state of being.</p><p>For Neville, baptism is an inner experience: the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">conscious choice to assume a new identity</a> and impress it upon the subconscious. Descending into the water represents sinking into the depth of your subconscious mind; emerging from it signifies the resurrection into a newly accepted self.</p><p>Spiritual rebirth is thus not an external act but a psychological transformation — <a href="/2025/05/the-crucifixion-symbol-of-maintaining.html">mentally "dying" to the old self and rising as the new</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Born of Water and Spirit: The True Rebirth</h2><p>Jesus underscores this inner transformation in John 3:5:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, "<a href="/2025/05/the-symbolism-of-water-in-bible.html">water</a>" represents the subconscious mind, the deep that receives the seed of new ideas, while "Spirit" represents the active creative force — the living assumption that sustains and gives life to that idea.</p><p>Being "born again" means <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">consciously stepping into a new self-concept</a> and living from that conviction, regardless of appearances.</p><hr /><h2>Peter’s Insight: The Waters that Save</h2><p>Peter connects Noah’s flood and baptism directly (1 Peter 3:20–21), stating that water now “saves you also — not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">clear conscience toward God.</a>”</p><p>This “clear conscience” symbolises a purified mental state — free from conflicting beliefs and self-doubt, anchored firmly in <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">the chosen assumption</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Jesus and the Boats: Mastering the Waters</h2><p>Throughout the Gospels, Jesus frequently teaches from boats and performs miracles on the water — walking on it, calming storms, and guiding fishermen to abundant catches. These stories are not mere demonstrations of supernatural power but psychological parables.</p><p>The boat symbolises the individual mind navigating the deep subconscious (the sea). Jesus, representing the awakened imagination, stands above or within this vessel, demonstrating dominion over the shifting, often turbulent waters of belief and emotion.</p><p>Teaching from a boat shows that truth must be shared from a place of mastery over the subconscious, not from being tossed about by it. Calming the storm (Mark 4:39) reflects quieting the chaotic thoughts within, while walking on water (Matthew 14:25–31) illustrates rising above doubts and fears through unwavering assumption.</p><hr /><h2>The Movement Upon the Waters: Continuous Creation</h2><p>The Spirit moving upon the waters in Genesis is the same creative movement that happens every time you adopt a new assumption. It is imagination acting upon the subconscious, forming the foundation for a new world.</p><p>You become the Noah of your own consciousness, building the ark of your assumption, immersing fully, and allowing the inner flood to wash away the old self. Like Jesus mastering the sea, you learn to walk above the waves of shifting circumstances through steadfast inner conviction.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion: Purify, Assume, Transform</h2><p>The flood, baptism, and Jesus’ miracles on water all point to the same essential process: cleansing the mind of doubt and limitation, assuming a new state, and thereby transforming one’s world from within.</p><p>These stories urge us not to see them as distant miracles but as practical instructions. Before you can manifest a new life, you must first purify your inner waters — clear out the sediment of old beliefs — and fully assume the new identity you wish to express.</p><p>Through the Law of Assumption, these water symbols reveal the power to dissolve the old and give birth to the new. In mastering your own inner waters, you unlock the ability to create a reality aligned with your highest vision.</p>
