<h1>Judah and Judas:  Recognition of Raised Assumption</h1>
<p>In the Bible, <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Judah</a> (Old Testament) and Judas (New Testament) share the same root name: <em>Yehudah</em>, meaning praise. Rather than seeing them as two separate figures, Neville Goddard’s psychological approach shows them as one character, during <a href="/2025/07/the-bibles-true-timeline-evolution-of.html">different stages of the law of Assumption.</a> Both reflect recognition of imagination as the true creative power.</p><h3>Judah: Praising the Hidden Creative Act</h3><p><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Judah, son of Jacob</a>, is the psychological mode of raised assumption, through which Jesus ultimately comes. His pivotal moment is when he <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">toys with the law of Assumption</a>. Tamar, personifying imagination as veiled and misunderstood, symbolises the hidden creative act — imagination at work behind the scenes.</p><p>When <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah</a> eventually admits, <em>“<b>She is more righteous than I</b>,”</em> he is recognising that the veiled, imaginative act was actually at work. </p><p>This is <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah’s moment of praise</a>: realising that imagination, though hidden and often misunderstood, is the righteous source of creation.</p><h3>Judas: Yielding to the Revealed Creative Power</h3><p>In the New Testament, Judas — the Greek form of Judah — repeats the pattern. He hands over Jesus, the personification of the I AM, the divine imagination. Rather than a betrayal, this act symbolises surrendering to imagination.</p><p>To “give up” Jesus is to let go of the old self and allow the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> to take its place. Like <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah recognising Tamar’s righteousness</a>, Judas recognises Jesus — imagination itself — as the true power.</p><h3>Two Moments, One Revelation</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>Judah recognises the hidden creative act (Tamar).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judas recognises the revealed creative power (Jesus).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Both acts are not betrayals but expressions of praise — recognising and honouring imagination.</p><h3>From Veil to Revelation</h3><p>In Tamar, imagination is veiled, hidden, and misunderstood. In Jesus, it is revealed and embodied as the I AM.</p><p>Judah and Judas represent two stages of the same awakening: the realisation that imagination is the only true creative and redemptive force.</p><p>As Neville says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Both figures play their part in letting that power rise.</p>
