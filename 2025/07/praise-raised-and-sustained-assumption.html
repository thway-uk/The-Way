<p>The early chapters of Genesis are not about two brothers in a field. They’re about you — and what you offer to yourself each moment in imagination. One state of mind is Abel: quiet, assumptive, faithful. The other is <b><a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Cain: angry, cynical, brooding</a></b> — convinced that life has wronged him, that others are chosen, that he is overlooked. But the truth is Cain doesn’t understand the law.</p>
<p>What law? That your <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">inner assumptions</a> create your world.</p>
<p>In Genesis 4:6–7, <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Cain is depressed</a>, his face fallen. Why? Because his offering is not accepted. But <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a> says something astonishing: <em>“If you do well, will you not be lifted up?”</em> In other words: if you assume rightly — if you bring the right offering — your inner state will be exalted. It is not the world punishing Cain. It is Cain refusing to rise.</p>
<p>Anger, sulking, jealousy — these are the signs of an unoffered self. They are the emotional residue of someone still worshipping the facts of life rather than their divine power to change them.</p>
<p>This isn’t about giving God a better gift. It’s about treating your own <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">imagination as God</a>.</p>
<p>To praise isn’t to flatter some external deity. Praise means <em>to raise</em> — to elevate your assumption of self. It means stopping the mental habit of defeat, bitterness, and passive resentment and choosing instead to <b><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">cleave to the vision of who you truly desire to be</a></b>.</p>
<p>As Genesis 2:24 says:</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife…”</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>The 'father and mother' are the psychological patterns you were raised with — the stories, limits, and emotional grooves you inherited. To praise is to leave those familiar, inherited assumptions and cleave instead to your desired identity — your ‘wife’. That <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">act of cleaving</a> is a form of praise. You lift your <a href="/search/label/Word%20of%20God%20Series">inner conversation</a>, you turn from complaint, you offer up your mind to its highest assumption.</p>
<p>Neville wrote: “<b><a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</a></b>.” But many Cain-states would rather assume rejection, pity, and injustice — not realising this is the only thing being “offered.” Not a lamb. Not grain. Just the state. And the state determines the outcome.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“And if you do not do well, sin is waiting at the door, desiring you…” — Genesis 4:7</strong></blockquote><p></p>
<p>Sin here is not moral failure. It’s <a href="/search/label/Hitting%20Or%20Missing%20the%20Mark%20%28AIM%29%20Series">missing the mark</a> of assumption. You haven’t imagined well — you’ve imagined poorly of yourself. You have offered up a low state. And that state rules over you until you lift your eyes and choose again.</p>
<p>Praise, then, is not a performance. It is an inner act of devotion to your higher self — the one you <em>choose</em> to be. When you refuse to dwell in the Cain-state, you are praising. When you walk away from the passive inner accusations and step into the bold feeling of “I AM,” you are praising.</p>
<p>The Messiah came through <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Judah</a> — the name meaning <em>praise</em>. Why? Because the power to transform begins not in the evidence, but in the assumption that dares to believe in its own divinity.</p></div>
