<h1>Yah, Iah, and El in Names: Identifiers of the  I AM</h1>
<p>The Bible is a profound symbolic narrative of unfolding self-perception. One of the most revealing keys to this inner drama lies in the names—especially those ending with <strong>-yah</strong>, <strong>-iah</strong>, or <strong>-el</strong>. These endings encode the presence and action of identifying names that point to the creative consciousness Neville Goddard highlights as the source of all manifestation.</p><p>This is why the <a href="/search/label/Genealogy%20Series">genealogies are so important</a> in the Bible, especially in the <a href="/2025/05/the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">lineage of Jesus.</a></p><h2>The Meaning Behind “-yah,” “-iah,” and “-el”</h2><p><strong>-yah</strong> and <strong>-iah</strong> are shortened forms of <strong>Yahweh (YHWH)</strong>, the sacred name of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> meaning <strong>“I AM”</strong>, the self-aware creative presence revealed in Exodus 3:14 as <strong>“<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>.”</strong> Names with this suffix signify the active presence of this conscious “I AM” working within the character or state symbolised.</p><p><strong>-el</strong> means <strong>“God”</strong> or <strong>“mighty one,”</strong> linked to <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Elohim</a></strong>, another divine name often understood as the creative power and authority behind all being. Names ending in <strong>-el</strong> connect the character to divine strength, power, or authority manifesting through imagination.</p><h2>Examples of Names and Their Symbolic Meanings</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah (Yeshayahu):</strong> “Yahweh is salvation” — the “I AM” presence as the source of deliverance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jeremiah (Yirmeyahu):</strong> “Yahweh will exalt” — conscious “I AM” raising the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hezekiah:</strong> “The strength of Yahweh” — the empowering force of “I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> “Who is like God?” — a rhetorical question affirming divine supremacy, with <strong>-el</strong> emphasising the might of the creative consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel:</strong> “God strengthens” — the power of Elohim energising transformation and renewal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each name reveals psychological modes: the character’s role or state reflects an aspect of self-perception manifesting through imagination. You can read the full list of <a href="/2025/05/the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">psychological modes in the lineage of Christ here.</a></p><h2>The Ultimate Example: Jesus</h2><p><a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">The name <strong>Jesus</strong></a> (Hebrew <strong>Yehoshua</strong> or <strong>Yeshua</strong>) means <strong>“Yahweh is salvation”</strong> or intimately, <strong>“I AM saves.”</strong> This is the supreme example of the “I AM” consciousness acting as the source of transformation and deliverance.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, Jesus is not a distant figure but the living embodiment of the awakened imagination—the self perceived “I AM” within each of us. The name itself declares the truth that your <strong>awareness of being</strong> is your true salvation and creative power.</p><h2>The Unified Creative Principle in Names</h2><p>Whether ending with <strong>-yah</strong>, <strong>-iah</strong>, or <strong>-el</strong>, these names point to the same underlying reality: the creative <strong>“I AM” consciousness</strong> expressing itself in various forms and functions. This reflects Neville Goddard’s core teaching that the self-aware imagination is the source of all manifestation.</p><p>The divine names encoded in these suffixes are linguistic markers of this creative process — the inner presence that assumes, feels, and brings reality into being.</p><h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>Recognising this pattern shifts your view from seeing biblical names as just labels to understanding them as symbolic declarations of the conscious <strong>“I AM”</strong> at work within you. This insight empowers you to consciously engage your imagination, embody your desired states, and master your creative power.</p>
