<h1>The Serpent: Thematic Repetition of Verse 3:14</h1>
<p>Like the <a href="/2025/05/the-word-seed-and-unity-of-consciousness.html">one rooted</a> in Genesis 1:11, numbers and patterns in the Bible often hold symbolic meaning beyond coincidence.  One striking example is the recurrence of the verse number <strong>3:14</strong> in three pivotal passages that speak directly to the creative power of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">imagination and spiritual awakening.</a></p><p>These three verses—<strong>Genesis 3:14</strong>, <strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>, and <strong>John 3:14</strong>—form a symbolic trilogy outlining the fall, the awakening, and the resurrection of our inner creative power.</p><hr /><h3>Genesis 3:14 — The Fall of Imagination into Dust</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.”</em><br />
—Genesis 3:14</p>
</blockquote><p>In this foundational verse, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> speaks to the serpent, symbolising the imagination and creative power. Neville Goddard interprets this as the <strong>falling asleep of imagination</strong>, descending into the physical, limited realm—“dust” symbolising the material body and unconscious mind.</p><p>The serpent, once a symbol of dynamic, elevated creative power, is now <strong>grounded and bound</strong> to the senses and separation, soon to be personified by Cain. This “fall” represents how <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">imagination</a> becomes dormant, restricted by doubt, fear, and identification with the physical world.</p><hr /><h3>Exodus 3:14 — The Awakening of Consciousness: “I AM”</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM WHO I AM.”</em><br />
—Exodus 3:14</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, God reveals the sacred Name to Moses—an eternal, self-existent “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>.” This is the moment of <strong>awakening</strong> to the true nature of consciousness.</p><p>Where Genesis 3:14 showed imagination asleep in the dust, Exodus 3:14 marks the <strong>revelation of the inner creative power</strong>—the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM within each person, the self-aware presence that transcends limitation</a>.</p><p>This is the call to remember and assume your divine nature, the creative “I AM” that is the source of all manifestation.</p><hr /><h3>John 3:14 — The Resurrection of Imagination</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”</em><br />
—John 3:14</p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus’ statement links the earlier imagery of the serpent lifted by Moses to his own being “lifted up” on the cross (or more accurately the Tree of Life).</p><p>This is the symbolic <strong>raising of the fallen imagination</strong> from the dust of limitation to the heights of conscious belief and creative power.</p><p>The serpent, once bound to the earth, is lifted and healed—just as the imagination, through the crucifixion and resurrection, is <strong>resurrected as the divine creative principle</strong> within.</p><hr /><h3>The Trilogy of Transformation: From Dust to Divine</h3><p>Taken together, these three verses mark a spiritual journey:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 3:14</strong>: Imagination falls asleep, bound by material limitation and unconsciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>: The eternal “I AM” reveals itself, calling for awakening and inner assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John 3:14</strong>: The resurrection—imagination lifted up in conscious faith and creative power.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the very heart of Neville Goddard’s teaching: your assumptions shape reality. When you raise your inner assumptions—your “I AM” state—above doubt and limitation, you bring about your own spiritual resurrection and manifestation.</p><hr /><h3>Walking in the Light of 3:14</h3><p>Jesus’ words in John continue the call:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</em> (John 12:32)</p>
</blockquote><p>This “lifting up” is the process of raising your consciousness beyond the “dust” to walk consciously in your creative power. It is the conscious choice to embody the I AM and manifest your desires as your reality.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: Embrace the 3:14 Pattern Within You</h3><p>The triple occurrence of 3:14 is not random—it invites you to recognise the pattern of your own awakening. You are invited to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Acknowledge where your imagination has fallen asleep in limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember the eternal “I AM” that dwells within you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rise, lift your assumptions, and walk in the light of conscious creation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Through this understanding, the Bible becomes a mirror for your inner transformation—showing the path <strong>from dust to divine</strong>.</p>
