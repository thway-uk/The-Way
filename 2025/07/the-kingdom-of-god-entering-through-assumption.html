<h1>The Kingdom of God: Entering Through Assumption</h1>
<p>Jesus declared, <em></em></p><blockquote><em>"The kingdom of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> is within you"</em> (Luke 17:21).</blockquote><p></p><p>According to Neville Goddard, this kingdom is not a distant realm to reach after death nor a reward for moral striving. It is a present, living reality — the creative power of your own imagination.</p><p>The Law of Assumption reveals that this inner kingdom is entered whenever you dare to <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled</a>. It is not about passively waiting for a miracle but about claiming your desired state boldly, as though it were already true.</p><p>When you choose to live from the end — to feel yourself already in possession of your goal — you move from seeking to being. In that moment, you occupy the kingdom. You act as a divine creator rather than a passive observer.</p><p>In this light, the kingdom of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> is not about place, but about state. It is the inner realm where all possibilities exist and from which all manifestations flow.</p><p>The Hebrew word <em><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Elohim</a></em> (Strong’s H430), often translated "God," also carries the meanings "<a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">mighty ones</a>," "judges," or "rulers." It's  highlighting our capacity to rule over our inner world. You are the judge of your inner kingdom; your assumptions are royal decrees that shape your external reality.</p><p>Thus, to enter the kingdom is to rule from within. By assuming your chosen state, you sit upon your inner throne, and your outer world must reflect your decree.</p>
