Every verse <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">plants a seed</a> of symbolic principle. When we reach Genesis 4:5-7, the word <em>sin</em> makes its first appearance—not as a list of taboos, but as something far more subtle and internal:<blockquote>
<p><em>".</em>.And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord was <b>pleased</b> with Abel's offering;</p>But in Cain and his offering he had <b>no pleasure</b>. And Cain was angry and his face became sad.<br /><br />And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you <b>angry</b>? and why is your face <b>sad</b>?<br /><br />If you do well, will you not have honour? and if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master."<br /> (Genesis 4:4-7, BBE)
</blockquote><p>This is not a scolding from a distant deity. It is a revelation of  law. A message from awareness itself to the outer <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> - Cain. And it is here that the true nature of sin is quietly defined, not as wickedness, but as misalignment. As <strong><a href="/2025/07/the-mark-of-beast-cains-mark-and-jesus.html">missing the mark</a></strong>.</p><hr /><h3>Sin as Missing the Mark</h3><p>The Hebrew word translated <em>sin</em> is <em>chatta’th</em>, from the verb <em>chata’</em>—to miss the goal, to fall short, to err. In this light, sin is not moral failure but imaginative error. To sin, in Neville Goddard’s terms, is to assume wrongly: to dwell in the state you do not wish to manifest.</p><p>Every time you imagine the worst, or assume defeat, or act from envy as Cain does — you miss the mark. You sin.</p><p>But look again at the verse:</p><blockquote>
<p>"If you do well, will you not be <b>honoured</b>?"</p>
</blockquote><p>In other words, if you assume well — if you align with the feeling of the wish fulfilled — your offering (your state) is accepted. The outer world reflects your inner state.</p><p>This is not punishment it's principle.</p><hr /><h3>The Inner Cain and Abel</h3><p>Neville Goddard describes Cain and Abel as two aspects of your own being. Cain is the <strong>outer man</strong>—your conscious reasoning mind, tied to appearances. Abel is the <strong>inner prototype</strong>—your imaginal activity, the state unseen but real.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cain</strong>, the outer man, brings an offering of the ground—what he has already cultivated in the visible world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abel</strong> brings the lamb—something more interior and symbolic: the assumption of already being.</p></li></ul><blockquote>"But in Cain and his offering he had <b>no pleasure</b>. And Cain was <b>angry</b> and his face became <b>sad</b>." — Genesis 4:5</blockquote><p><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> “had <i><a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a></i> in” Abel’s offering because of its content, and because it aligns with the principle of creation</p><p>Here, the word <em><a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a></em> resonates deeply with the Hebrew meaning behind the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Garden of Eden</a> itself—a state of <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">perfect harmony and alignment</a> within. This pleasure signifies the inner condition of being in tune with creation’s order, the very state lost when outer <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> separates from imagination. Cain’s offering fails to evoke this pleasure because it reflects the outer man’s focus on visible, cultivated things rather than the imaginal assumption of the wished-for state.</p><p>Thus, <strong>pleasure</strong> here symbolises the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Edenic</a> harmony of <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">imagination and reality unified</a>—the foundational state necessary for manifestation and spiritual fulfilment.</p><p>Cain’s anger, then, is not just emotional—it’s symbolic of how the outer man resents the unseen nature of imagination. Cain refuses to believe that the inner world governs the outer. But here comes the warning:</p><blockquote>
<p>"Sin is waiting at the door, desiring to get control over you: but you are to get the better of it."</p>
</blockquote><p>This “sin” is at the threshold of consciousness. It crouches at the edge of assumption. It desires to be expressed — but <strong>you may rule over it</strong>.</p><hr /><h3 style="text-align: left;">The "Mark of the Beast"</h3><p>In Genesis 4:15, <a href="/2025/07/the-mark-of-beast-cains-mark-and-jesus.html">God set a mark upon Cain</a> — a sign not of exile, but of a state marked for transformation. Mystically, this foreshadows the work of <a href="/2025/06/crucifixion-cross-or-tree-symbolic.html">Jesus on the cross</a>, where all states of sin and separation are redeemed by the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new assumption</a>. While the word "<a href="/2025/06/crucifixion-cross-or-tree-symbolic.html">cross</a>" does not literally mean "mark," it has come to symbolise the <a href="/2025/07/the-supreme-symbol-why-jesuss.html">ultimate sign of transformation</a>: the fixing of the old self in order to <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">rise anew</a>.</p><hr /><h3>You May Rule Over It</h3><p>Here is the heart of the matter: <strong>You are not the victim of sin — you are its master.</strong> Imagination is not a wild force to be feared. It is your servant.</p><p>Sin lies at the door when you forget who you are. When you allow yourself to assume weakness, lack, or jealousy. But you may choose differently. You may rule over the inner narrative. You may assume, and persist in assuming, the state you desire.</p><p>And if you “do well” - if you embody the feeling of the wish fulfilled—will you not be honoured? Will not your world reflect it?</p><p>This is the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, hidden in the very soil of Genesis.</p><hr /><p>Genesis 4:7, then, is not a story about ancient brothers. It is the first utterance of spiritual law: the principle of assumption ministering manifestation. The real sin is not moral impurity, but misdirected imagination. The warning is kind, not cruel: be mindful of what you dwell on. Desire will follow you but <strong>you may choose which state it follows</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rule over the assumption, and the world will yield.</strong></p>
