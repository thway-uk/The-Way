<h1>Man In His Image: Eyes of Fire and Eyes of Doves</h1>
<p>There are moments when a <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> appears—not a man of flesh and bone, but a radiant image charged with meaning. In Daniel’s vision, this figure arrives <a href="/2025/05/the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">clothed</a> in linen, eyes burning like fire, feet like polished brass. In the <a href="/search/label/Song%20of%20Solomon%20Series">Song of Solomon</a>, he is seen again—but now he is the beloved, his legs like marble, his lips dripping with myrrh. To the casual reader, these may seem like two different portraits. But when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, they reveal a single unfolding story: the transition from beholding the desired state to embodying it.</p><p>Daniel trembles before the vision of the Ideal. The Shulamite rests in its arms.</p><p>This post traces the symbolic language of both visions—how gold, fire, alabaster, and beryl represent aspects of the self in transition. And it invites you to see that what once appeared distant and divine is the very state you are called to assume.</p><hr /><h2>Genesis 1:26 — The Divine Pattern of Self-Conception</h2><p>Before exploring these visions, we must return to Genesis 1:26:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then God said, ‘Let us <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">make man </a>in our image, after our likeness…’”</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, "<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a>" does not signify a physical body but the <strong>awareness of being itself</strong>. In Hebrew, "adam" relates to "ground" or "earth," suggesting a vessel shaped and animated by consciousness. Yet the deeper focus is on “image” and “likeness.”</p><p>The <strong>image</strong> is the inner conceptual form—how you imagine yourself to be. The <strong>likeness</strong> is the outer expression—how this inner image unfolds into experience.</p><p>This verse symbolises the first great act of self-perception: <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> looking upon itself and forming an identity. It is the prototype of manifestation. When <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> says, “<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Let us make man</a>,” it is not a discussion among deities but the inner creative dialogue within the mind: the interplay of "I AM" (pure awareness) and "that which I assume myself to be" (self-concept).</p><p>As Neville Goddard taught, every time you say “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>,” you begin a creative act. Genesis 1:26 reveals that "man" is formed in the image of this I AM—the divine creative principle. This is the same spiritual man who appears in Daniel and Solomon: first as an awe-inspiring vision, then as a beloved embodiment.</p><hr /><h2>Biblical Descriptions Side by Side</h2><table>

The Radiant Image: From Distant Ideal to Living Assumption</h3><p>Daniel’s <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> is radiant, clothed in lightning and fire—an overwhelming revelation of the "I AM" as an abstract, exalted state. This is the first encounter with the Genesis image: consciousness beholding its infinite potential but not yet claiming it.</p><p>In Solomon, the same divine <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">image</a> becomes a beloved, intimate presence. The woman does not tremble before it; she delights in it. This reflects Genesis 1:26 not merely as an ideal to worship but as a state to embody. You move from fearing the divine image to becoming it.</p><hr /><h3>2. Symbolic Body: Vision to Union</h3><p>Daniel’s <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> is priestly and remote, wrapped in linen. Solomon’s Beloved is sensuously described—hair, eyes, hands, belly, legs—revealing full integration.</p><p>This echoes Neville’s principle: the initial vision (Daniel) is a glimpse of your ideal self, which may feel distant or “too holy.” Persisting in assumption transforms that vision into lived embodiment (Song of Solomon), fulfilling the command of Genesis to reflect the divine image and likeness.</p><hr /><h3>3. Eyes of Fire vs. Eyes of Doves</h3><p>Daniel’s fiery eyes pierce illusion and burn away false identities—symbolising the fierce clarity needed to first awaken to the divine image.</p><p>Solomon’s dove-like eyes represent gentle, unwavering love—the restful gaze of consciousness once it has fully accepted its divine nature. The same image, but transformed through union.</p><hr /><h3>4. Voice of a Multitude vs. Mouth Most Sweet</h3><p>Daniel’s "voice of a multitude" reveals the collective creative power of consciousness—the echo of all possible assumptions.</p><p>Solomon’s "mouth most sweet" suggests intimacy: the voice of I AM now softened into personal sweetness. The creative power becomes not just universal, but individually known and cherished.</p><hr /><h2>From the Garden to the Beloved</h2><p>Genesis 2:8 describes God placing man in the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Garden of Eden</a>—a symbol of the mind itself. This "garden" is the field of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> where awareness plants, tends, and reaps every state. The man of Genesis is not a passive creation but an active self-perceiver, given "dominion"—authority over thoughts and feelings, symbolised by "fish of the sea" (deep emotions) and "birds of the air" (fleeting thoughts).</p><p>In Daniel, this man appears as a blazing ideal, reminding you of your original divine image. In the Song of Solomon, he is the fully assumed state, the Beloved dwelling in the <a href="https://www.thway.uk/search/label/Eden%20Series">garden</a> of the mind, intimately embraced.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion: From "I AM" to "I AM That"</h2><p>Genesis 1:26 sets the foundation: man is the image and likeness of God—the power to be aware and to assume. Daniel shows the initial awe of perceiving this true self; Solomon shows the sweetness of living in union with it.</p><p>Neville Goddard taught that every state already exists and is waiting to be assumed. You are not merely to worship the divine image; you are to become it, moving from vision to union, from distant <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">"I AM</a>" to intimate "I AM that."</p><p>In the end, what began as a blazing, unreachable ideal becomes your very own expression—the Beloved in whom you find rest.</p>
