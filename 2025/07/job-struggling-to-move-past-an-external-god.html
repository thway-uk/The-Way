<h1>Job: Struggling To Move Past An External God</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote>"I am disgusted with my life.<br />Let me complain freely.<br />My bitter soul must complain." — Job 10:1</blockquote></div><p>The Book of Job is not a record of external events, but a <a href="/2025/07/the-bibles-true-timeline-evolution-of.html">psychological unfolding</a>: the soul’s passage through suffering, loss, and ultimately restoration — not by begging an external deity, but by discovering <strong>the power of assumption</strong> and reclaiming identity in <strong><a href="htt/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html" target="_blank">I AM</a></strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Job Despairs of His Birth</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 10:8–9 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Your hands fashioned me and made me... Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Here, Job’s consciousness collapses into deep existential grief. Neville would interpret this not as rebellion, but as the <strong>dark night of the soul</strong> — when man can no longer understand what is happening and questions his very creation. This stage often precedes awakening. The clay is the <strong>form</strong> — but the spirit within is <strong>eternal imagination</strong>. </p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Zophar Speaks: Harsh Doctrine Masquerading as Truth</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 11:6 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Zophar is the harshest friend — a state of consciousness that <strong>clings to guilt</strong>, declaring suffering as justified. It is the voice of unworthiness, which Neville often warned about.<br />
Zophar represents <strong>a limiting belief about self</strong>, keeping Job bound in despair by making him feel he is inherently flawed.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Job Affirms the Power Within (Unknowingly)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 12:13 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“With God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Even amid despair, Job unconsciously affirms the truth: that <strong>wisdom and might lie with God</strong> — and, as Neville taught, <strong>God is your imagination</strong>. These flickers of truth in Job’s speech are the <strong>breaking through of deeper knowing</strong>, even if his conscious mind hasn't yet grasped their meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Eliphaz Again: Repeating Limiting Ideas</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 15:20–22 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The wicked man writhes in pain all his days... He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, and he is marked for the sword.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Eliphaz, returning with more fear-based doctrine, voices a persistent subconscious belief: <strong>if you are in pain, it must be deserved</strong>. Neville would identify this as a <strong>self-fulfilling prophecy</strong> — an assumption of guilt projected onto life. This is not divine punishment, but the <strong>fruit of inner belief</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Job’s Flickering Hope and Perception of a Redeemer</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 19:25–26 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
This is the most powerful and prophetic shift in the book. Neville would point to this as Job <strong>glimpsing the indwelling Christ</strong> — the I AM within.<br />
Though Job still sees the Redeemer as separate, he senses a deeper truth: <strong>restoration comes not through outer rescue, but through inner resurrection</strong>. This is the beginning of <strong>divine remembrance</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Job Challenges the Mind of Doctrine (Bildad Again)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 25:4–6 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How then can man be in the right before God? ... even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Bildad now reflects the voice of <strong>absolute unworthiness</strong>. Neville would call this a <strong>state of mind in total disconnection from God within</strong>, seeing only distance, lack, and futility. This state must be confronted and rejected before the soul can ascend into divine union.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Job Begins to Declare the Superiority of Inner Wisdom</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 28:12–13 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Man</a> does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Here, Job breaks away from the logic of the friends and begins his own <strong>inner search</strong>. Neville would say this is the turning inward — the realisation that wisdom is <strong>not in the world</strong>, but in <strong>consciousness</strong>. The “place of understanding” is <strong>within</strong> — in the silence of assumed identity.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>God’s Speech Continues the Awakening</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 40:9–10 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendour.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
This is not humiliation — it is <strong>invitation</strong>. <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> is saying: <strong>Step into your divine power.</strong> Neville would say this is your imagination urging you to <strong>put on the state</strong>.<br />
To "clothe yourself with splendour" is to <strong>assume the fulfilled identity</strong>. This is the call to remember that you are not broken or condemned — you are a creator.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>18. Final Realisation and New Self</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Job 42:5–6 (ESV)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
This is the moment of true shift: <strong>from belief to embodiment</strong>. Job had “heard” of God — doctrines, second-hand knowledge — but now he <strong>sees</strong>, meaning he <strong>knows</strong> through direct inner experience.<br />
Repentance here (as Neville always said) is a <strong>radical change of mind</strong> — a shedding of the old man and rising into a new state of consciousness.</p>
