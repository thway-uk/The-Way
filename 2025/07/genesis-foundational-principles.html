These figures reflect inner conversations — beliefs, doubts, desires — revealing the unfolding journey of self-awareness and transformation. The narrative of the Bible is the <a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">psychological return to Eden - that is pleasure and delight</a><p></p>

  <p>The Bible defines itself from the beginning of Genesis. These are the key Bible verses behind <a href="/2025/06/only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s</a> core teachings<span style="color: #990000;"><b>.</b> </span><span><span style="color: #990000;">It is crucial to grasp these concepts at the outset. The entire narrative connects back to them, unveiling a profound mystery</span><span style="color: darkred;">.</span></span> Here are the premises to help the reader begin interpreting Scripture through it's intended narrative:</p>

  <h3 class="def">THE DEFINITION OF GOD: <small>Genesis 1:1</small></h3>
  <div class="bible-quote">“In the beginning God created…”</div>
  <p>The Hebrew word rendered 'God' is <a href="https://www.thway.uk/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html" target="_blank"><em>Elohim</em></a>, a plural term meaning judges, rulers, and powers. It symbolises the manifold aspects of your mind and imagination at work. <a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">Ezekiel’s “wheels within wheels</a>,” full of eyes, symbolise the self-perceiving and ever-revolving movements of self-perception. The <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">twelve sons, twelve tribes, and twelve disciples</a> are personified examples of these powers convening to support the assumption. </p>

  <h3 class="def">TIMELINE OF EVENTS:</h3>

  <div class="bible-quote">“The law of Assumption as it permeates and develops in conscious awareness”</div>

  <p>Here is a summarised timeline of events as the law of Assumption permeates and develops in the mind through the narrative of scripture.</p>

  <h3 class="def">IMAGINATION AS THE SEED OF LIFE: <small>Genesis 1:11</small></h3>
  <p>The <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">seed</a> of every experience is planted in imagination. everything reproduces after its kind because the seed is in itself—a direct metaphor for how imagination creates reality. It's the first mention of the <a href="/2025/05/eden-within-two-trees-four-rivers-and.html">two trees</a> in the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Garden of Eden</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="def">MAN AS INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTION OF SELF: <small>Genesis 1:26</small></h3>
  <div class="bible-quote">“God said, Let Us make <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html" target="_blank">man in Our image</a>.”</div>
  <p>Imagination is the union of self-perception and imaginative aspects of mind. The "judges", "rulers" and "powers" of your mind named <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>, convene to create your perception of self. "<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Man</a>" refers to your self-concept — who you are <i><b>aware of being</b></i> — not a physical form. Any male or female character in the Bible is a <b>psychological concept of your mind</b>.</p>

  <h3 class="def">WOMAN AS THE RESPONSE TO SELF-PERCEPTION: <small>Genesis 2:23</small></h3>
  <p>"Woman," called forth by <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a>, symbolises your externalised world, every condition and event shaped by what you have accepted as true within.</p>

  <h3 class="def">LOVE: <small>Genesis 2:24</small></h3>
  <p>One of the most important verses. Here begins the symbolism of love, joining, and marriage within the mind, upon which the rest of the Bible narrative rests.</p>

  <h3 class="def">SIN: <small>Genesis 4:4-7</small></h3>
  “And the <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Lord was <i>pleased</i></a> with Abel's offering.....But in Cain and his offering he had <b>no pleasure</b>. And Cain was <b>angry</b>”
  <p>Sin is first defined here as the difference between imagining delightfully and negatively.</p>

  <h3 class="def">"I AM": <small>Exodus 3:14</small></h3>
  <div class="bible-quote"><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM THAT WHICH I AM”</a></div>
  <p>God is your “I AM” — the awareness of being — seated and conceived in imagination.</p>
