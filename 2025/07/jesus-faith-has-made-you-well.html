<h1>Jesus: Faith Has Made You Well</h1>
<p>In the <a href="/2025/07/advanced-mastery-of-manifestation-part.html">fast-paced Gospel of Mark</a>, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 5:27–29</strong><br />
<em>"When she had heard the things concerning Jesus, she came in the crowd behind him, and put her hand on his robe. For she said, If I may only put my hand on his robe, I will be made well. And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that she was healed of her disease."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a tale of physical healing. It is a spiritual, psychological and reproductive allegory—an inner drama between the individual<strong> in a continuous state of wanting</strong> and the<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"> <strong>I AM</strong></a>, your <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">creative imagination</a>. Neville Goddard taught that Scripture is psychological, not historical, and this story beautifully illustrates a key movement in the process of the law: the imaginative shift from <strong><i>wanting</i></strong> to <strong><i>being</i></strong>.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Blood: A Symbol of Unfulfilled Imagination</h3>
<p>The <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> had suffered from an “issue of blood” for twelve years. Symbolically, this is not illness—it is a <strong>reproductive metaphor</strong>. The Bible often uses bodily imagery to describe the states of the mind, and in this case, the <em>issue of blood</em> aligns with <strong>menstruation</strong>—the monthly shedding that signifies <strong>no conception</strong>.</p>
<p>In psychological terms, this represents a <strong>cycle of desire without fulfilment</strong>. She wants something deeply, but she never conceives it. She leaks energy, day after day, into the feeling of "<i>wanting it</i>" and <em>“not yet.”</em> Her assumptions are never made fertile. The creative union between desire and belief never takes place. She remains in a continual state of spiritual menstruation—a vivid image of <strong>the mind’s repeated failure to impregnate itself with assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Twelve years—the number of fullness and structure—suggests that she has <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">been bound in this loop</a> long enough. The time has come for a new conception.</p>
<h3>Touching the Robe: The Moment of Inner Union</h3>
<p>She says within herself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If I may only touch his robe, I will be made well.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She no longer waits for permission, proof, or outward change. She <strong>enters the state</strong> of healing, however briefly. This is not superstition or desperation—it is an act of fulfillment not desire. She reaches for the <strong>robe</strong>, which symbolises the outermost layer of identity—the feeling of the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">wish fulfilled</a>.</p>
<p>She touches it—and something happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 5:30</strong><br />
<em>“And Jesus, straight away feeling in himself that power had gone out from him...”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a important moment, rich in symbolic meaning. If Jesus represents the I AM, then the <em>power going out of him</em> suggests a release of creative energy—the moment when the imagination responds <strong>fruitfully</strong> to a perfectly assumed state. Just as the <em>issue of blood</em> is a sign of barrenness, <strong>this outflow is a symbol of <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">successful inner union</a></strong><a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">, a kind of <strong>psychological consummation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In the subtlest of ways, this passage uses <strong>reproductive language</strong> to convey an inner truth. Her years of fruitless wanting are brought to an end in a single moment of <strong>felt union with the fulfilled state</strong>—and power is released.</p>
<p>Neville would describe this as the moment the <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">seed is planted in consciousness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You are healed because you dared to assume.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>“Your Faith Has Made You Well”</h3>
<p>Jesus turns and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 5:34</strong><br />
<em>“Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be free from your disease.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn't say <em>I healed you.</em> He says <em>your faith</em>—your willingness to <strong>touch the feeling of already having</strong>—was the cause. It wasn’t the robe. It was her union with the <strong>assumption of wellness</strong>.</p>
<p>This is what separates her from the crowd. Many touched him outwardly, but she touched him <strong>in consciousness</strong>. She no longer desired to be healed—she accepted <em>“I AM healed.”</em> That moment of belief produced the change.</p>
<h3>From Seeking to Conceiving</h3>
<p>This is not a story about two individuals, but two <strong>states within you</strong>. The woman is the part of your mind that yearns, strives, and waits. Jesus is the imagination, the I AM, always ready to respond when the assumption is made. Their meeting is your own <strong>moment of conception</strong>—when the soul no longer bleeds with wanting, but <strong>rests in fulfilment</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville put it simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You must dare to assume you are what you want to be—and remain faithful to that assumption.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is then that the seed is planted, the bleeding stops, and you are pregnant with fulfillment.</p>
<p>This is the fruit of faith.</p>
