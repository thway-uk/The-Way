<h1>Events Recorded in All Four Gospels: Universal Threads</h1>
<p>In a Bible woven with countless details, it is striking how few moments are chosen by all four Gospel writers — <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John</a> — to be recorded.</p><p>When an event is echoed in all four, it signals deep importance, pointing us toward the <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">foundations of faith and inner transformation</a>.</p><p>Below, we explore the <strong>five key events</strong> that appear in all four Gospels, comparing their portrayals and reflecting on their spiritual meanings.</p><hr /><h2>1. The Baptism of Jesus</h2><p><strong>References:</strong> Matthew 3:13–17, Mark 1:9–11, Luke 3:21–22, John 1:29–34</p><blockquote>
<p>"And Jesus, when he had been baptised, came straight up out of the water: and the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God <a href="/2025/05/creation-reenacted-poetic-parallels.html">coming down like a dove </a>and resting on him; And a voice came out of heaven, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased." — Matthew 3:16–17 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
All four Gospels present this moment as the awakening of divine identity within. <a href="/2025/05/creation-reenacted-poetic-parallels.html">The Spirit descending</a> as a dove symbolises the realisation that the creative power of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> — imagination — is now recognised and active. The voice -<a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html"> first demonstrated in the  beginning</a> - declares this new <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self-image</a></p><hr /><h2>2. The Feeding of the 5,000</h2><p><strong>References:</strong> Matthew 14:13–21, Mark 6:30–44, Luke 9:10–17, John 6:1–15</p><blockquote>
<p>"And they all took of the food and had enough: and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used." — Matthew 14:20 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
This miracle illustrates the multiplying power of imagination. What little you have in hand can be blessed and expanded through faith. The twelve baskets signify spiritual completeness — when imagination is exercised fully, abundance is the natural result.</p><hr /><h2>3. The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem</h2><p><strong>References:</strong> Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19</p><blockquote>
<p>"Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your King comes to you, gentle, and seated on an ass, and on a young ass, the offspring of a beast used for work." — Matthew 21:5 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
Jesus riding on a donkey while crowds shout "Hosanna!" marks the recognition of the awakened imagination as king of one’s world. The donkey symbolises humility; divine power comes quietly, without outward grandeur. The consciousness must accept this creative force as its ruler for true transformation to begin.</p><hr /><h2>4. The Crucifixion</h2><p><strong>References:</strong> Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, John 19</p><blockquote>
<p>"And Jesus gave another loud cry, and gave up his spirit." — Matthew 27:50 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
The crucifixion represents fixing an idea in imagination. To <a href="https://www.thway.uk/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">"crucify" a desire</a> is to commit it so completely to consciousness that it dies to the external world and lives within. This death is essential for resurrection — the idea’s outer manifestation. Thus, the cross symbolises the inner triumph of certainty and commitment.</p><hr /><h2>5. The Resurrection</h2><p><strong>References:</strong> Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20</p><blockquote>
<p>"He is not here, for he has come to life again as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was." — Matthew 28:6 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Meaning:</strong><br />
The <a href="/2025/07/the-supreme-symbol-why-jesuss.html">resurrection</a> symbolises the externalisation of the inner reality. What has been "crucified" in imagination now rises and takes form in the outer world. It is the triumph of belief over appearance — the final proof that creation happens first within.</p><hr /><h2>Ask, Believe, Receive: The Universal Practice</h2><p>Underneath these five Gospel events runs the living thread of <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">Ask, Believe, Receive</a></strong>, explicitly taught by Jesus in each Gospel:</p><blockquote>
<p>"Make a request, and it will be answered; search, and you will find; give the sign, and the door will be opened to you." — Matthew 7:7 (BBE)<br />
"For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it." — Mark 11:24 (BBE)<br />
"And I say to you, Make a request, and it will be answered; let your search be, and you will get what you are searching for; give the sign, and the door will be opened to you." — Luke 11:9 (BBE)<br />
"Up to now you have made no request in my name: make a request and you will receive, so that your joy may be full." — John 16:24 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>This triad is not simply a method to get things; it is a deep spiritual process:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask</strong>: Recognise and honour your desire without shame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Believe</strong>: Hold the conviction joyfully, fixing it in imagination as already true (as in the crucifixion of the idea).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receive</strong>: Allow the manifestation to arise naturally, as the resurrection follows the cross.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We see this mirrored in the sequence of events:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/2025/04/the-parallel-between-noahs-flood-and.html">Baptism</a> (Ask: recognition of divine desire)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2025/05/feeding-5000-gospel-comparison.html">Feeding</a> (Believe: trust in abundance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry (Acceptance: welcoming the imagination as king)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">Crucifixion</a> (Commitment: fixing the idea completely)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/2025/07/the-supreme-symbol-why-jesuss.html">Resurrection</a> (Receive: experiencing fulfilment)</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>The Number Four: Foundation of the Gospel Pattern</h2><p>The <a href="/search/label/Numbers%3A%20Four">number four</a> holds deep symbolic meaning in Scripture. It is no accident that there are four Gospels — each providing a <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">complete foundation for participation</a> in the law of Assumption.</p><p>Before the Gospels, we see <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four key patriarchs in the Hebrew stories</a>, each symbolising a foundational state of consciousness:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/search/label/Abraham%20Series">Abraham</a></strong>: Faith — the courage to leave old limitations and step into the unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/search/label/Jacob%20Series">Jacob</a></strong>: Persistence — the struggle and transformation of the inner self, wrestling until a blessing is given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/search/label/Joseph%20Series">Joseph</a></strong>: Imagination — the dreamer who sees the future and guides reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/search/label/Judah%20Series">Judah</a></strong>: Praise — joyful thanksgiving, the expressive acknowledgment of divine abundance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four pillars </a>prefigure and support the Gospel narrative. They are the <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">psychological groundwork </a>for the story of Jesus, the awakened imagination, to unfold.</p><p>Thus, the four Gospels reflect the same  structure: a complete foundation for the act of raising <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">self-perception</a> in each individual.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion: Why These Events Matter</h2><p>Though the Gospels vary in style and detail, these five shared moments stand as a unified spiritual pattern:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong> (Baptism)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provision</strong> (Feeding of the 5,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong> (Triumphal Entry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong> (Crucifixion)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fulfilment</strong> (Resurrection)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each stage mirrors the journey of inner transformation.</p><p>When we allow the imagination to awaken, commit to it completely, and hold steadfast even through the "death" of old forms, we too experience resurrection — the living manifestation of our highest visions.</p>
