<h1>Anger: Cain, Lamech, and Jesus</h1>
<p>In <strong>Genesis 4:15 (BBE)</strong>, God places a <em>mark</em> on Cain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And Jehovah said to him, ‘No man who kills Cain shall be punished, but he shall be punished seven times more.’ Then Jehovah put a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cain’s <a href="/2025/06/the-hebrew-secret-of-mark-tav.html">mark</a> symbolises a mind weighed down by sasness, anger, fear, hopelessness, guilt, loneliness, and separation — an inner state “<a href="/search/label/Hitting%20Or%20Missing%20the%20Mark%20%28AIM%29%20Series">missing the mark</a>” and caught in negative, wild beast-minded patterns.</p>
<p>Later, <strong>Lamech’s declaration</strong> in Genesis 4:24 intensifies this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If Cain will be punished seven times, then Lamech seventy times seven.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This echoes Jesus’ teaching on forgiveness in Matthew 18:21-22 (NIV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ‘Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?’<br />
Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.’”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Lamech’s vow and <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>’ teaching highlight the mind’s potential to become trapped in endless <a href="/2025/05/spiralling-thoughts-and-mental-health.html">loops (wheels)</a> of injury, resentment, and reactivity — “seventy times seven” symbolises the repetitive nature of <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">mental wounding</a>.</p>
<p>Together, Cain’s <a href="/2025/06/the-hebrew-secret-of-mark-tav.html">mark</a> and Lamech’s vow portray the deep psychological struggle of the human mind caught in destructive thought loops <a href="/2025/05/spiralling-thoughts-and-mental-health.html">(wheels)</a>. Jesus’ teaching calls for breaking this cycle — moving beyond woundedness toward forgiveness, healing, and conscious transformation.</p><p><strong>Interpreting Seven and Seventy Through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</strong></p><p>The numbers seven and seventy, rich with <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew symbolism</a>, relate directly to how we assume and create our reality.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Seven</strong> represents completion and the natural cycle of creation — like the seven days in Genesis where everything is formed through assumption. It’s the perfect rhythm of imagining your desire as already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seventy</strong>, linked to the Hebrew letter Ayin meaning “eye,” points to self-awareness and perception — how clearly you see and feel your inner state.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>When Jesus talks about forgiving “seventy times seven,” it’s a metaphor for continuously choosing to forgive and shift your self perception (the eye), even when old negative patterns try to hold you back.</p><p>Neville teaches that what you assume consistently in your imagination shapes your outer world. The “seventy times seven” reminds us that spiritual and mental transformation often requires repeated conscious effort — repeatedly choosing the feeling of forgiveness, peace, and alignment until it becomes your new reality.</p><p>In this way, the cycle of seven and seventy is about mastering your inner vision and imagination until your external life reflects your highest assumption.</p>
