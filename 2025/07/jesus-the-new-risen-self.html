<h1>Jesus: The New Risen Self</h1>
<p>When we explore the Bible through Neville Goddard’s teachings and the Law of Assumption, we see that it is not just a book of moral commandments but a psychological guide. Among all the events described in scripture, none is more vital than <strong>Jesus’s resurrection</strong>. While much is said of his <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucifixion</a>, it is his rising — his resurrection — that holds the true key to transformation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Fixing the idea: the necessary crucifixion</h3>
<p>The <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucifixion</a> is often viewed as a moment of sacrifice and suffering. In symbolic terms, it represents the fixing of an idea in consciousness — the moment you completely accept and “<a href="/2025/05/the-nails-and-name-crucifixion-yhvh-and.html">nail</a>” your <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new assumption</a>. You die to the old state, letting it fall away so that a new self can be born.</p>
<p>However, this is only the preliminary act. The real creative power, according to the Law of Assumption, lies not in the nailing but in <strong>what follows</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Rising as the triumph of assumption</h3>
<p>The resurrection represents the <strong>living realisation</strong> of the new state. It is the moment when the new self is fully embodied and made alive. You no longer merely hold an idea in mind; you now <em>walk in it</em>, think from it, and respond to the world as it.</p>
<p><a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus’s</a> resurrection is described vividly in the Gospels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen!"</em> (Luke 24:5–6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage symbolises the truth that your new state cannot be found among old mental patterns ("the dead"). Once you have risen, you no longer identify with past failures, doubts, or limitations. You have moved beyond them entirely.</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"He is not here, for he has risen, as he said."</em> (Matthew 28:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This line underscores the Law of Assumption principle: <em>"as he said"</em> — your word, your assumption, precedes and produces your rising. Once you have <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">accepted a new idea of yourself</a>, you must rise into it, proving its reality by embodying it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Appearing in closed rooms: beyond limitation</h3>
<p>After his resurrection, <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> appears in surprising, almost dreamlike ways — symbolising how, when you fully accept a new state, you transcend old limitations and conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"On the evening of that first day of the week, when the <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">disciples</a> were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.'"</em> (John 20:19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite <a href="/2025/05/the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">locked doors</a>, he appears effortlessly. This signifies that when you embody your new state, external "<a href="/2025/05/the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">locked doors</a>" — seeming barriers in life — cannot hinder your expression. You move through obstacles as if they do not exist, because to the new self, they truly do not.</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"A week later his <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">disciples</a> were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you!'"</em> (John 20:26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, he appears even to those still in doubt (like Thomas), showing that the risen state is so certain, so alive, that it must be acknowledged even by the <b><i>most skeptical parts of your mind</i></b>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Ascending into your new identity</h3>
<p>After these appearances, <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> ascends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"While he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven."</em> (Luke 24:51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final act is the crowning moment of the Law of Assumption: the full and permanent elevation of your self-perception. The new state is no longer a temporary visitation — it becomes your dwelling place, your heaven.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Living in the end: the true resurrection</h3>
<p>Neville insisted that the Law of Assumption is about <strong>living in the end</strong> — feeling from the fulfilled desire, not merely thinking of it. The resurrection is the Bible’s grand symbol of this principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You accept the new state (crucifixion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You rise into it, living from it (resurrection).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You ascend, dwelling in it permanently (ascension).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: the triumph of "I AM"</h3>
<p>The story of Jesus’s resurrection invites us to move beyond perpetual "fixing" and into the joy of embodiment. It calls us to stop returning to the tombs of old stories and instead to <em>walk in the light of the new state</em>, to move confidently as if the wish were already fulfilled.</p>
<p>In Neville’s words, "Dare to assume you are what you want to be, and you will compel conditions to conform to your assumption." The resurrection is the boldest invitation to do exactly that — to rise now.</p>
