It is no longer a book of laws and prohibitions, nor a record of historical events, but a manual for awakening to the power of assumption—your imagination, and <b><a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">rediscovering the joy of living from fulfilment.</a></b> Through this lens, we find that pleasure is not the enemy of God, but <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">His very signature</a>. The whole of Scripture, from Eden to Revelation reveals a single truth: assumption is the divine act, and <b><i>pleasure is its fruit</i></b>.</p>
<h2>Eden: The First Picture of Assumptive Delight</h2>
<p>The Bible begins with a garden called Eden. The Hebrew word עֵדֶן means “<b>delight</b>” or “<b>pleasure</b>.” That’s the foundation. Humanity wasn’t placed into a wilderness to toil and strive—it was placed in a setting of beauty, abundance, and joy. Genesis says God “planted a garden eastward in Eden,” and placed man there to enjoy it.</p>
<p>This image isn’t about an ancient lost paradise. As Neville taught, Eden is within. It is the <b><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">original state of consciousness</a></b>: the moment we assume the feeling of a fulfilled desire, we are once again in <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">Eden</a>. When you imagine and feel that something is already yours, you are operating from the same principle by which the <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">garden was planted</a>.</p>
<h2>Jesus and the Return to Inner Joy</h2>
<p>Throughout the Gospels, <a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> doesn’t teach self-denial for its own sake. He says, “Ask and it will be given to you… that your <b>joy may be full</b>” (John 16:24). This is the formula: Ask, Believe, Receive. It isn’t about suffering for virtue’s sake, but about entering a state of inner knowing where the <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html"><b>desired thing is already yours</b></a>. The reason joy is “full” in this state is because joy itself is a sign that the assumption has been accepted.</p>
<p>Neville was clear that faith is not begging or waiting. It is assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled—and feeling the delight of it.</p>
<h2>Cain and Abel: Duty Versus Delight</h2>
<p>One of the most revealing early stories is that of <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Cain and Abel</a>. Both make offerings, but only Abel’s is accepted. Why? Abel offers “the fat” from his flock—<b>the best, the most delightful portion</b>. Cain offers “the fruit of the ground”—the result of his own toil. But his offering brings him no joy, and when it isn’t accepted, he becomes <b>angry and downcast.</b> God says to him, “If you do well, will you not be honoured?” But Cain doesn’t understand. He thinks effort is enough. What <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">God</a> desires is not labour, but delight. This isn’t about sacrifice—it’s about the spirit in which something is given. Do you offer from joy, or from obligation?</p>
<p>Neville interpreted sin as “missing the mark”—failing to assume the end joyfully. The story of Cain and Abel is not about two brothers, but two states of consciousness: one rooted in assumption, the other in effort.</p>
<h2>The Psalms and Prophets: A River of Pleasures</h2>
<p>The Bible is <i><b>saturated with imagery of pleasure as a divine state</b></i>. Psalm 36 speaks of drinking from “the river of your pleasures.” Isaiah promises that the desolate soul will be made “like Eden,” filled with joy and music.</p>
<p>This isn’t poetic fluff. These are psychological truths. When you align yourself with what you desire through imagination, the experience is one of internal joy. The river of <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">God’s pleasure</a> flows through your own acceptance.</p>
<h2>The Song of Songs: A Sensual Scripture?</h2>
<p>Many have been puzzled by the intense sensuality of the <a href="/search/label/Song%20of%20Solomon%20Series">Song of Solomon</a>. Gardens, perfumes, kisses—it seems more like romantic poetry than spiritual teaching. But Neville saw the sensual as symbolic. The Song celebrates the union of the soul and its assumption. The pleasure isn’t carnal; it’s creative. It is the garden restored—not by effort, but by <b><i>love and delight</i></b>.</p><p></p><blockquote>"<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> my beloved's, and my beloved is mine." — Song of Solomon 6:3</blockquote><p></p>
<h2>Revelation: Paradise Restored</h2>
<p>In the final pages of the Bible, <b><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">we return to Paradise</a></b>. “To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">paradise of God</a>” (Revelation 2:7). The Garden, the Tree, the joy—they’re all there again. This isn’t a reward in the afterlife. It’s a description of the state of consciousness when the assumption is fixed and joy is full.</p>
<p><a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> tells the thief on the cross, “Today you will be with me in Paradise.” Not someday. Not after penance. Today—because he believed, and in that belief, was transported.</p>
<h2>The Joy of Assumption: A Sacred Act</h2>
<p>If Eden is pleasure, and Jesus teaches joy through belief, then it becomes clear: divine pleasure is not indulgent. It is the natural consequence of <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">imagining rightly.</a> The Bible is not asking us to avoid pleasure, but to find it in the right place—in consciousness.</p>
<p>To assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled is to return to Eden. And when you feel joy in that assumption, it is not a trick of the mind. It is a sign that you are aligned with <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">God</a>.</p></div>
