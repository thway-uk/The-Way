<h1>Revelation: Angels and Trumpets</h1>
<p>Revelation 8 has long puzzled readers with its powerful and sometimes unsettling images. Yet, when approached through Neville Goddard’s understanding, and the bible's language of imagination, we see that Revelation is not a prophecy of external disasters, but a symbolic story of the minds realisation — the gradual discovery and rightful use of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a>. The scenery in revelation is a repeat of the <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">creation story</a>, but now the revelation that imagination is the creative power.</p><p>Even the very word <em>Revelation</em> (meaning <em>unveiling</em>) points us inward. It is not about the destruction of the world outside but about revealing the hidden creative power — the "<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>" — within each of us. Neville taught that the Bible is not a record of outer events but a guide to inner transformation through imagination.</p><hr /><h2>The Opening of the Seventh Seal: The Silence of Assumption</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>"And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour."</strong> (Revelation 8:1, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>The seventh seal symbolises the final unveiling — the complete realisation that<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"> <em>I AM</em></a> is God within. The silence that follows is not just stillness; it represents resting in the fully assumed state.</p><p>Neville often described this as the "stillness after the imaginal act," where you rest confidently in your assumption, knowing it is already done.</p><p>The "silence for about half an hour" symbolically mirrors the <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">first seven days in Genesis, where God rested after creation</a>. This resting is crucial — it is the moment of inner stillness when you stop questioning and allow the new state to be fixed.</p><p>In this silence, the <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">seed</a> of your new assumption is germinating unseen, preparing to express in the outer world.</p><hr /><h2>The Seven Angels and the Trumpets: Activating Inner Powers</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>"And I saw the seven angels who were before God; and they were given seven horns."</strong> (Revelation 8:2, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>The seven angels represent the ministering aspects of your mind — the divine faculties that support and express imagination intentionally. </p><p>The trumpets (or horns) are calls to action. Each sounding is an inner announcement that a new state is taking shape, moving from imagination to manifestation.</p><p>With each trumpet, your mind becomes more aligned with your chosen assumption, progressively transforming your reality.</p><hr /><h2>The Golden Vessel: Prayer as Assumed Feeling</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>"And another angel came and took his place at the altar, having a gold vessel for burning perfume; and much perfume was given to him..."</strong> (Revelation 8:3, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>This angel symbolises another inner faculty. The golden vessel represents a mind purified by faith, filled with the "perfume" of assumed feeling.</p><p>For Neville, prayer is not asking or pleading — it is assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. As the smoke of the incense rises, so does your imaginal act ascend into the deeper layers of your mind, where it is accepted and prepared for manifestation.</p><p>Air, often symbolic of imagination, is the unseen medium that sustains all life. Just as smoke needs air to rise, your imaginal act requires the fertile atmosphere of imagination to be lifted into creative power.</p><hr /><h2>Casting Fire into the Earth: Imagination Made Manifest</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>"And the angel took the vessel; and he made it full of the fire of the altar and sent it down on the earth: and there came thunders and voices and flames and an earth-shock."</strong> (Revelation 8:5, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, we see the imaginal act — the "fire" — being sent into the "earth," which represents the subconscious and eventually the physical world.</p><p>The thunder, lightning, and earthquake symbolise the outer disturbances that often follow a new assumption. Neville warned that after adopting a new state, your external world may temporarily appear chaotic. This is not a sign of failure but of old structures breaking down to make way for the new.</p><hr /><h2>The First Four Trumpets: The Collapse of Old States</h2><p>Each trumpet symbolises the falling away of former beliefs and patterns:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hail and fire mixed with blood</strong>: Violent removal of outdated thoughts and self-concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A great mountain burning with fire thrown into the sea</strong>: Emotional upheaval dissolving deep-rooted limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The star called Wormwood making the waters bitter</strong>: The bitterness of realising the emptiness of old ways of thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A third part of the sun, moon, and stars darkened</strong>: Loss of reliance on external guidance, forcing you to turn inward to your "I AM".</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Though these images are intense, they point to necessary inner cleansing — a clearing of all that holds you back from fully embodying your true self.</p><hr /><h2>Revelation as Inner Realisation</h2><p>In Neville’s interpretation, Revelation 8 is not a forecast of disaster but a symbolic map of soul transformation.</p><p>It describes the silence of resting in the assumption, the activation of divine faculties, the offering of purified imagination, and the dramatic breaking down of old states to prepare for new life.</p><p>Revelation, in this light, is the complete understanding and rightful use of imagination. It is the unveiling of God within — the realisation that we are both the creators and the creations, and that "I AM" is the ultimate power behind all we experience.</p>
