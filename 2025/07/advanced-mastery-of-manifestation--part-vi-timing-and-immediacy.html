<h1>Advanced Mastery of Manifestation — Part VI: Timing and Immediacy</h1>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Principle of Immediacy: "I Come Quickly"</h4><p>One of the most overlooked yet fascinating threads in the Bible is the principle of <strong>immediacy</strong> — the idea that divine action is not delayed, but ever-present and instantly accessible.</p><p>In Revelation, Christ declares <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">three</a> times:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>"Behold, I come quickly" (Revelation 22:7).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me" (Revelation 22:12).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Surely I come quickly" (Revelation 22:20).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These are not promises of a far-off future event but declarations of <strong>imminent, inner arrival</strong>. In symbolic interpretation (as taught by Neville Goddard), this "coming" is the moment you fully assume a new state of being. It is the instant readiness of your own "<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>" to embody a new identity.</p><p>The Gospel of Mark echoes this principle through its constant use of the word <strong>"immediately"</strong> (<em>εὐθύς</em>). Mark uses it over 40 times, far more than any other Gospel, creating a breathless sense of urgency and unstoppable movement. <a href="/2025/06/the-hebrew-secret-of-mark-tav.html">Mark</a> is also symbolically tied to the <strong>cross</strong>, which represents the <a href="/2025/06/the-hebrew-secret-of-mark-tav.html">fixing of an assumption</a> in imagination — the moment a new state is accepted as reality. "Immediately" signals that the shift is not theoretical or gradual; it begins the moment you claim it.</p><p>Other passages reinforce this divine immediacy:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear."</strong> (Isaiah 65:24) — showing that response is not postponed but already in motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."</strong> (2 Corinthians 6:2) — pointing to the present moment as the only true moment of transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."</strong> (Hebrews 3:15) — urging immediate receptivity rather than waiting.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This same principle of immediacy shines through the stories of the <a href="/2025/05/bride-at-well-parallels-between-rebekah.html">brides at the well</a> — Rebekah “<b><i>hasted</i></b>” and “<b><i>ran</i></b>” to draw water, reflecting the subconscious mind’s swift response to conscious assumption (Genesis 24:18, 20). In the <a href="/search/label/Song%20of%20Solomon%20Series">Song of Solomon</a>, the beloved is seen “leaping upon the mountains” and the <a href="/2025/05/bride-at-well-parallels-between-rebekah.html">bride</a> calls, “<b><i>Make haste, my beloved</i></b>” (Song of Solomon 2:8; 8:14). These images express the same eternal message: the <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">union between your conscious desire and the creative power within</a> is not delayed. It is swift, eager, and always now — fulfilling the promise of “I come quickly.”</p><p>The Bible’s use of words like "<i><b>quickly</b></i>," "<b><i>immediately</i></b>," "<b><i>now</i></b>," and "<b><i>today</i></b>" are not just stylistic choices; they are invitations to realise that <strong>spiritual transformation is an instantaneous process</strong>, unfolding in <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self perception</a> before it becomes visible to the senses.</p><p>The repeated "I come quickly" is not a distant promise but a statement of eternal readiness: the divine creative power within you is always at hand, waiting only for your decision to assume a new state.</p><p>Thus, the true "second coming" is perpetual and personal, a continual return to awareness of your creative power. It is the swift, silent movement of imagination — always now, always immediate.</p>
