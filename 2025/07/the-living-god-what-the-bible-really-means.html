<h1>The Living God: What the Bible Really Means</h1>
<p>The Bible speaks repeatedly of <strong>“<a href="/p/elohim-god.html">the living God</a>”</strong> as a deliberate and layered declaration. To call <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God <em>living</em></a> is to distinguish Him from lifeless forms, idols, and abstract tradition. But more deeply, it signals that <strong>God is an active force — present, moving, and creating now</strong>, within you.</p>
<p>Interpreted through a spiritual framework — such as that found in the teachings of Neville Goddard — this phrase points to <strong>God not as a distant being</strong>, but as <strong>your own “I AM,” alive within consciousness</strong>.</p>
<p>And at the root of this living <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>God is the name Elohim</b></a> — the very first name given to God in the Scriptures. Understanding this name opens the door to seeing what <em>living</em> truly means.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Elohim”: The Plural Power of God-Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>Genesis 1 opens with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.”</em><br />
— Genesis 1:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Elohim” is a Hebrew word that appears <strong>grammatically plural</strong>, yet it takes <strong>singular verbs</strong>. This means it suggests a <strong>composite unity</strong> — many-in-one. Symbolically, it points to <strong>the creative power of consciousness itself</strong>, which manifests in countless forms, yet arises from <strong>a single source: awareness.</strong></p>
<p>Neville Goddard often explained that <strong>God is your own wonderful human imagination</strong> — the part of you that assumes, feels, creates, and experiences. Elohim, then, can be understood as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>divine plurality of all assumed states</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>creative totality of your inner world</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>many expressions of the one I AM</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This Elohim is not static or abstract. He is the God who <em>creates</em> — not once, long ago, but <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><strong>continually</strong>, through <strong>every imaginal act</strong></a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Living God Is Not Carved, but Creative</strong></h2>
<p>In contrast to Elohim, the gods of surrounding nations were idols — fixed images, incapable of response or motion. The Bible says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God…”</em><br />
— Jeremiah 10:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means God is not dead history, but <strong>present movement</strong>. Not a system of rules, but <strong>a living law</strong> — the law that what you assume to be true will express itself.</p>
<p>This “living” aspect separates the <strong><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God of imagination</a></strong> from the <strong>god of external form</strong>. The former is alive, ever-becoming. The latter is dead — bound by repetition, tradition, and fear.</p>
<p>To speak of the <strong>living God</strong> is to speak of the <strong>Elohim within</strong> — the plural power of imagined realities, ever-creating, ever-responsive.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>God Is Living Because He Is Felt and Known Within</strong></h2>
<p>To say “God lives” is not to refer to a deity somewhere in the sky, but to the <strong>experience</strong> of God <em>in</em> the individual — in <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do you not know that you are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?”</em><br />
— 1 Corinthians 3:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not metaphor — it is metaphysical fact. You do not observe the living God — <strong>you become aware of Him through the movement of assumption</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you dare to imagine something beyond the facts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you persist in that vision despite appearances,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you praise as though it’s already yours —</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>— you are touching the <strong>living Elohim</strong>, the divine plural presence that creates the world through your inner activity.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>God of the Living, Not the Dead</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> affirms this inner living God when he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</em><br />
— Matthew 22:32</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is not remembered in the past — He is <strong>known in the present</strong>. He is not trapped in tradition, but <strong>encountered as direct awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>In this sense, to speak of <strong>the living God</strong> is to recognise that <strong>Elohim is alive within you</strong> — not as doctrine, but as <strong>imagination in motion</strong>. Every assumption you accept, every feeling you inhabit, every identity you fix in mind — that is Elohim creating.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Living God = Living Assumption</strong></h2>
<p>If Elohim is the many-in-one source of creation, and that creation happens through assumption, then the <strong>living God</strong> is the <strong>living assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>He lives whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new identity is accepted within,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A belief becomes so real it reorders experience,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person dares to claim what they have not yet seen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are never waiting for the living God. <strong>You are the arena in which He acts.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Conclusion: To Know Elohim Is to Live Creatively</strong></h2>
<p>Elohim is the first name of God because it expresses the <strong>first principle of being</strong> — that consciousness is plural in potential, singular in essence, and eternally creative.</p>
<p>To say “the living God” is to reject the idea of a dead or distant deity. It is to say:<br />
<strong>"God is here. God is now. God is alive in me — as me — imagining, assuming, becoming."</strong></p>
<p>Let others serve gods of stone and memory. We serve <strong>the living God</strong> — the Elohim within — who speaks as “I AM,” and whose breath is every conscious act of faith.</p>
