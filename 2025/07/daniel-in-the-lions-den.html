But seen through Neville Goddard’s teachings, it reveals the mystery of spiritual life: <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">your world is yourself pushed out</a>, and every challenge is a test of your unwavering assumption.</p>
<h2>Daniel as the Embodiment of the Assumed State</h2>
<p>Daniel is described as being "of the children of Judah" (Daniel 1:6), and Judah means "praise." Symbolically, this shows that Daniel’s power in the lions’ den arises from a foundation of inner praise</p><p>Daniel symbolises the individual who dares to live fully from the end — the one who has <a href="2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">assumed his desired state</a> as already true. He is not moved by appearances or threatened by opposing circumstances. He has taken refuge in his chosen identity and feels it so completely that no external condition can shake him.</p>
<p>When Daniel is accused and thrown into the lions’ den, it symbolises what happens when your <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new state</a> is tested by the seeming facts of life. The lions represent all outer appearances, facts, and reactions that seem to oppose or threaten your assumption.</p>
<h2>The Lions: Outer Evidence and Opposition</h2>
<p>The lions are not merely wild beasts; they are symbolic of every fearful thought, every fact that screams “impossible,” every condition that appears to contradict your desire.</p>
<p>When you decide to assume a new state of being — to feel yourself to be healthy, abundant, loved — your old beliefs and circumstances often appear like roaring lions. They seem dangerous, eager to devour your new assumption.</p>
<p>Yet Daniel does not fight these lions. He does not plead or try to escape. He simply remains still and faithful. In Neville’s words, he "lives in the end" — fully confident that what he has assumed must come to pass.</p>
<h2>The Sealed Stone: Fixing the State</h2>
<p>The story mentions that the den was sealed with a stone and the king's signet. In Neville’s teaching, this points to the act of fixing an idea in imagination. Once you have truly accepted a state inwardly — “sealed” it with feeling — it cannot be altered by outer interference. It is done.</p>
<p>The king’s signet represents the authority of consciousness itself. Your own awareness seals the assumption, making it untouchable by outer facts or opinions.</p>
<h2>The Morning: Manifestation</h2>
<p>At dawn, the king rushes to the den and finds Daniel alive and unharmed. In the symbolic drama, this is the moment of manifestation. When the assumption is held faithfully, reality inevitably reflects it. The lions (outer facts) have no power to harm the one who stands unmoved in his chosen state.</p>
<p>The joy of the king represents the conscious recognition that the I AM is creative and faithful. Outer reality always follows the inner movement.</p>
<h2>The True Message</h2>
<p>This story is not about an external God saving a man from physical lions. It is about the power of an unshaken assumption. It is a map for anyone who dares to imagine boldly and remain steadfast in that vision despite appearances.</p>
<p>When you occupy your chosen state so fully that you will not accept anything contrary, all facts of life — even the fiercest “lions” — must eventually align to support you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
