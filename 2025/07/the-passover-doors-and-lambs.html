<h1>The Passover: Doors and Lambs</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">The Bible is not an ancient record or moral code, it is a living psychological drama. Every story, every symbol, is a blueprint for understanding the deeper workings of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> and the creative power within us. Among its most profound symbols is the <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">lamb, first appearing in Genesis</a> and culminating in the Passover story. This progression reveals the secret of sin, sacrifice, and ultimate liberation through imagination.</div><h3>The First Lamb: Pleasure and Anger in Genesis</h3><p>The lamb first appears in Genesis 4:4–7, in the story of <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">Cain and Abel</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>"And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord was pleased with Abel’s offering; but in Cain and his offering he had no pleasure. And Cain was angry and his face became sad. And the Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry? and why is your face sad? If you do well, will you not have honour? And if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master.'"</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not a primitive moral fable. It is a revelation of spiritual law. In Hebrew, the word for sin — <em>chatta’th</em> — means “to miss the mark.” Sin here is not moral wickedness but misdirected imagination: dwelling in states that deny or contradict the desired outcome.</p><p>Abel’s lamb offering pleases the Lord because it represents the inner man’s assumption of already being — the acceptance of the invisible reality as true. Cain, the outer man, brings an offering from the ground, symbolising reliance on visible facts and cultivated efforts rather than faith in imagination.</p><p>The "<a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a>" in Abel’s offering is not emotional indulgence but the deep resonance of harmony, like the <a href="/search/label/Eden%20Series">state of Eden</a> — inner alignment between imagination and manifestation. Cain’s anger embodies the resistance of the outer mind, which resents the unseen power of imagination. Here, we are told sin “crouches at the door.” In Hebrew symbolic structure, the “<a href="/2025/04/unlocking-power-of-doors-neville.html">door</a>” (<em>dalet</em> in the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet, from Mathers’ correspondences</a>) represents the threshold of consciousness — the gateway through which assumptions enter and become reality.</p><h3>Sin at the Door: The Power of Assumption</h3><p>The warning to Cain is timeless: "<i><b>Sin is waiting at the door... but you may rule over it.</b></i>" In Neville Goddard’s teaching, this means that the creative power of imagination is always present, ready to express whatever state we accept. We are not passive victims; we are rulers of assumption.</p><p>When you assume lack, fear, or envy — you sin. You miss the mark. But you can choose differently. You may rule over sin by consciously aligning with the feeling of the wish fulfilled, thereby “doing well” and being honoured through outer reflection.</p><h3>The Passover Lamb: Deliverance Through Assumption</h3><p>This <a href="/search/label/Shepherd%20and%20Lamb%20Series">foundational symbolism of the lamb</a> reappears powerfully in Exodus. During Passover, the Israelites are instructed to sacrifice a lamb and mark their <a href="/2025/04/unlocking-power-of-doors-neville.html">doorposts</a> with its blood:</p><blockquote>
<p>"And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses..." (Exodus 12:7)</p>
</blockquote><p>The blood on the <a href="/2025/04/unlocking-power-of-doors-and-windows.html">doorposts</a> is not a barbaric ritual act. It is a metaphysical declaration: a marking of consciousness. The <a href="/2025/04/unlocking-power-of-doors-and-windows.html">doorposts</a> represent the same “threshold” as in Genesis — the entry point of awareness. The <a href="/2025/04/the-scarlet-thread-symbolism-and.html">blood, symbolising life force and imagination</a>, seals this entry with a new assumption: freedom, deliverance, and the end of bondage.</p><p>Just as Abel’s lamb represents the pure offering of the inner man, so too the Passover lamb signifies the decision to reject the bondage of Pharaoh — the external world’s limitations — and to claim liberation through inner conviction. The "passing over" of death is the movement from one state of <a href="/2025/05/the-door-shepherd-and-beloved-exploring.html">consciousness to another</a>, transcending fear and stepping into the Promised Land of fulfilled imagination.</p><h3>Jesus as the Lamb: The Inner Covenant</h3><p>This <a href="/search/label/Shepherd%20and%20Lamb%20Series">lamb symbolism</a> reaches its fullest expression in the figure of <a href="h/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>, described as "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). Here, sin again refers to imaginative error — the tendency to identify with limitation and separation.</p><p>At the <a href="/2025/04/the-breaking-of-bread-melchizedek-last.html">Last Supper</a>, Jesus reframes the Passover meal as the new covenant:</p><blockquote>
<p>"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26:28)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is not about literal blood sacrifice but about adopting a new inner agreement. The “blood” signifies the life force of imagination. The "forgiveness of sins" is the release of <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">misaligned assumptions</a> and the embrace of our creative nature as “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>” — the divine name revealed in Exodus 3:14.</p><h3>From Bondage to Liberation</h3><p>The lamb’s journey — from Genesis to Exodus to the Gospels — mirrors the journey of consciousness itself. In Genesis, the lamb teaches us about the pleasure of inner alignment and the danger of misdirected emotion. In Exodus, it becomes the mark of deliverance through decisive assumption. In Christ, it symbolises the full awakening to our divine creative power.</p><p>The true “passing over” is not merely escaping physical danger but moving beyond the enslaving states of doubt, resentment, and fear. The doorpost, symbolically, is the mind’s threshold. The blood is the conscious marking of this threshold with new assumptions of life, abundance, and freedom.</p><h3>You May Rule Over It</h3><p>The central message remains: <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">sin desires to master you, but you may rule over it</a>. Your assumptions shape your reality, and you have the authority to choose them. The Passover lamb invites you to sacrifice old identities and boldly claim your freedom.</p><p>Abel’s offering, the blood on the doorposts, the Lamb of God — all point to this one principle: Imagination creates reality. Assume the state desired. Persist in it. Rule over the inner narrative. And your world will honour your inner offering.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Living Drama of the Lamb</h3><p>The Bible’s lamb is not a call to religious ritual but an invitation to inner mastery. From the symbolic “pleasure” in Abel’s lamb to the Passover’s blood and Christ’s covenant, we are guided to understand sin as misalignment — a missed aim — and to realise our power to correct it.</p><p>When you consciously mark your mind (the doorpost) with the blood of your chosen assumption, you declare your freedom from all inner Pharaohs. You move from bondage to the promised state, from outer-driven action to inner creative certainty.</p><p>You are not the servant of sin; you are its ruler. And the lamb is your eternal reminder.</p>
