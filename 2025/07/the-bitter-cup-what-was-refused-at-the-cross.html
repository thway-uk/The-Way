<h1>The Bitter Cup: What Was Refused at the Cross</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>“They offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.”</em><br />
<em>(Matthew 27:34, ESV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment of greatest vulnerability, <i><a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a></i>—the awakened imagination—is offered a bitter drink: wine mixed with gall. The drink is tasted, but refused.</p>
<p>This act is deeply symbolic.</p>
<p>Bitter water appears throughout the Bible as a sign of "non-pleasantness" the <a href="2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">antithesis to the psychological dwelling of Eden</a>. Here, in this final offering, it represents the <strong>bitterness of the world</strong>, the disillusionment that threatens the inner vision.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that <a href="2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus represents </a><b><a href="2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">imagination in the action of saving</a> </b>—the <em>assumption</em>, the inner knowing of "I AM." To drink this sour wine would mean accepting the narrative of despair, which is the <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">foundational premise given as sin</a>.</p>
<p>But it is refused.</p>
<p>The bitterness is acknowledged, but not absorbed. This is <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">true mastery</a>: the ability to face pain and limitation without becoming tainted by them.</p>
<p>Walking this path means knowing your assumption even when the outer world seems contrary. It means standing firm in vision, saying, “No—I will not let bitterness take hold.”</p>
<p>Refusing the bitter cup honours the inner world, preserving the creative waters—the living Mem—pure and fertile, ready to bring forth what has been faithfully imagined.</p>
