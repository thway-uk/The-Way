<p>The story of Absalom in the Bible is filled with betrayal, family drama, and a tragic end. However, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, the tale takes on a deeper meaning—one that speaks to the <a href="/2025/07/the-ego-and-true-i-am.html"><b>power of the ego</b></a>, our personal desires, and most intriguingly, our thoughts. A small but significant detail in Absalom’s story—the mention of his hair—offers a profound symbol of how our thoughts shape our reality, and how attachment to our ego can lead to self-destruction.</p><h3>The Tree of Judgment: Absalom and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h3><div><blockquote>"And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so."— Genesis 1:11</blockquote></div><p>A crucial but often overlooked detail is the tree itself—the great oak in whose branches Absalom’s hair gets caught. Symbolically, this tree represents the <strong><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</a></strong>—the path of judgment, division, and ego-driven thought patterns. Unlike the <b><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a></b>, which stands for <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">unified consciousness</a> and assumption, the Tree of Knowledge embodies the mind trapped in duality, comparing, judging, and clinging to appearances.</p><p>Absalom’s entrapment in this tree vividly illustrates how the ego’s thoughts—symbolised by his hair—can become ensnared in the web of judgment and pride. The very thing that once symbolised strength and beauty becomes the instrument of his downfall.</p><p></p><blockquote>“And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you must not eat, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.’” — Genesis 2:16–17 (NIV)</blockquote><p></p><hr /><h3>The Significance of Absalom’s Hair</h3><p>In 2 Samuel 14:25-26, the Bible describes Absalom’s hair in great detail:</p><blockquote>
<p>“But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. And when he pulled his head, for it was at every year’s end that he pulled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he pulled it: he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Absalom’s hair is not just a physical trait; it’s a source of pride and a symbol of his vanity. From a Neville Goddard perspective, his hair represents the ego and its attachment to personal appearance, recognition, and external validation. Neville often emphasised that our thoughts shape our reality, and in this case, Absalom's hair could be seen as a metaphor for the thoughts we hold about ourselves and our need for admiration.</p><h3>Hair as Thoughts: The Connection to Ego</h3><p>In Neville’s teachings, thoughts are powerful creators of our reality. Just as Absalom’s hair represents his pride and identity, every strand of hair can symbolise a thought or belief that shapes his sense of self. The more we focus on our external appearance, achievements, or how others see us, the more we feed our ego with thoughts that make us feel superior or important.</p><p>Absalom’s hair grows year after year, accumulating weight, much like how our thoughts accumulate over time. Each thought, belief, or assumption we entertain adds another layer to our identity, often strengthening the ego. And just like Absalom, we can become trapped by our attachment to these thoughts.</p><h3>The Moment of Tragedy: Absalom’s Hair Traps Him</h3><p>In 2 Samuel 18:9, Absalom’s hair plays a key role in his tragic downfall:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This moment is significant because Absalom’s hair—his attachment to his self-image—becomes the very thing that traps him. In Neville’s teachings, this could be seen as a metaphor for how our thoughts and beliefs, when not aligned with our higher self, can entrap us. The tree symbolizes external circumstances that we can’t control, and Absalom’s hair represents the accumulation of ego-driven thoughts that keep us stuck. Just as Absalom is trapped, we can become ensnared by the thoughts that define our ego.</p><h3>Every Hair as a Thought: The Power of Your Mind</h3><p>Neville Goddard often taught that each thought has creative power. When we allow our thoughts to be dominated by the ego—fueled by pride, desire for approval, or personal attachments—we are essentially adding weight to our mental “hair.” Absalom’s hair growing year after year reflects how we can allow ego-driven thoughts to accumulate, making them harder to manage or control.</p><p>In this sense, each strand of Absalom’s hair can represent a thought or belief that we cling to. Over time, these thoughts accumulate, and we may become overly attached to the idea of who we think we are, or who we want others to think we are. Just like Absalom’s growing hair, these thoughts can weigh us down and make us feel trapped.</p><h3>Why Absalom’s Hair Represents the Ego and Thought Patterns</h3><p>Absalom’s hair is a powerful symbol of the ego’s attachment to external validation and the thoughts that reinforce it. In Neville Goddard’s view, the ego thrives on thoughts of superiority, vanity, and pride. The longer we feed our ego with such thoughts, the heavier they become, ultimately holding us back from living in alignment with our true self.</p><p>Absalom’s story teaches us that when we focus too much on external recognition—whether through our appearance, achievements, or the way we think we should be perceived—we are essentially giving power to our ego-driven thoughts. These thoughts, much like Absalom’s hair, can grow heavy and eventually entrap us, preventing us from living authentically or moving forward.</p><h3>The Final Lesson: Letting Go of the Ego’s Grip</h3><p>Absalom’s tragic end, as described in 2 Samuel 18:14, serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of clinging to the ego:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This act of ending Absalom’s life symbolizes the destruction of the ego. The ego, when allowed to dominate our thoughts and beliefs, ultimately leads to self-sabotage and inner conflict. Neville Goddard teaches us that true power comes not from the ego, but from aligning with our higher self, the <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html"><b>"I AM.</b></a>" By releasing attachment to ego-driven thoughts, we free ourselves from the traps that keep us stuck.</p><h3>Conclusion: Letting Go of the Ego and Thoughts</h3><p>The story of Absalom’s hair offers a profound lesson: our thoughts shape our reality. Absalom’s hair, once a symbol of pride, ultimately becomes the thing that traps him, just as our attachment to ego-driven thoughts can trap us. If we want to avoid this fate, we must become aware of the thoughts we are cultivating. Every thought, like every strand of hair, contributes to the reality we create.</p><p>When we let go of the thoughts that fuel our ego and align with our true self, we break free from the mental traps that limit our potential. The key is not to identify with the superficial image we create through our thoughts, but to recognize the deeper, unchanging truth of who we are. By doing so, we become the creators of our reality, free from the weight of unnecessary attachments.</p>
