<h1>Twelve Sons and Tribes: List of Attributes</h1>
<p>The twelve tribes of Israel are not just names in an ancient lineage — they are <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">symbolic faculties of mind, the inner <em>Elohim</em> or "judges and powers" named God that shape your self-perception</a>. Each tribe, through its Hebrew meaning, represents a distinct mental or emotional quality contributing to the creative process within.</p><p>Later, these tribes find their echo in the twelve disciples of Jesus. This shift from tribes to disciples is not simply a historical or generational change — it is a psychological evolution: a movement from dispersed, unconscious potentials to consciously named and directed powers supporting the assumption. The <a href="/2025/06/lukes-genealogy-lineage-to-god.html">lineage of Christ shows the names of the psychological states passed through</a>.</p><p>This narrative traces the journey through the Law of Assumption, revealing how the inner Elohim — your many mental states — must be harmonised and consciously commanded to create your desired world. What you inwardly accept as true is precisely what your outer world reflects.</p>
