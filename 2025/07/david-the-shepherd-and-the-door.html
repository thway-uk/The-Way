<h1>David: The Shepherd and the Door</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not history but <strong>psychological allegory</strong> — a map of imagination and consciousness. At the center of this symbolic system lies the <strong><a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">“I AM”</a></strong> — your awareness of being. When read through this lens, passages like <strong>John 10</strong>, <strong>Song of Solomon 5</strong>, and <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong> reveal a unified teaching: your inner state determines your outer world. The door is not outside you — it is the threshold of your own assumption.</p><hr /><h2><strong>John 10: The Door and the Shepherd</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.”</em><br />
— <strong>John 10:9</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus declares himself both the <strong>door</strong> (adore!) and the <strong>shepherd</strong>. Neville saw this as a declaration of <strong>spiritual law</strong>: the “door” is a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>, and to “enter through it” is to <strong>assume the identity you wish to express</strong>. Salvation, pasture, and safety come not from doctrine, but from entering the right state. Jesus saying <b><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">"I AM" represents imagination identifying and working within the powers of God.</a></b></p><p>The sheep in this passage symbolize different <strong>states of being</strong>, each awaiting attention. The shepherd — the one who directs awareness — is your own inner faculty of <strong>imagination</strong>. You guide the flock of potential states by what you choose to assume as true.</p><hr /><h2><strong><a href="/search/label/Song%20of%20Solomon%20Series">Song of Solomon</a>: The Latch and the Beloved</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“My beloved put his hand through the latch of the door, and my heart yearned for him.”</em><br />
— <strong>Song of Solomon 5:4</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the <a href="/2025/04/davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">beloved</a> does not break the door open — he touches the <strong>latch</strong>. This intimate image symbolizes the <strong>inner mechanism</strong> of <strong>permission</strong>. The latch must be lifted from within — a picture-perfect symbol of how manifestation requires <strong>inner consent</strong>.</p><p>Just as in John 10, where the door must be entered consciously, here the <a href="/2025/04/davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">beloved's</a> presence evokes longing — the <strong>felt sense of the imagined self</strong> at the threshold of awareness. The yearning heart is <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">consciousness awakening to desire</a>. The moment the latch is lifted — the moment belief aligns — the door opens to fulfillment.</p><hr /><h2><strong>David: The Beloved Shepherd and the Union of Doors</strong></h2><p>The name <a href="/2025/05/law-of-assumption-creative-pattern.html"><strong>David</strong> (דָּוִד) is spelled Daleth-Vav-Daleth — literally, <strong>door–nail–door</strong>. In Hebrew symbolism</a>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Daleth (ד)</strong> means "door"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vav (ו)</strong> means "nail" or "connector"</p>
</li>
</ul><p>David’s name becomes a <strong>living symbol</strong>: <strong>two doors joined</strong>. He represents the <strong>union of inner and outer thresholds</strong> — the inner state and its outer expression.</p><p>As the shepherd-king and “beloved,” David is the <strong>embodied self that results from harmony between imagination and assumption</strong>. He ties directly into John 10 — both as shepherd and as door. He is also the beloved sought in Song of Solomon.</p><p>Thus, David becomes the <strong>messianic archetype</strong>: the fully integrated man whose inner latch is lifted, and who walks through the door of assumption with authority.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Genesis 4: The First Door and the Nature of Sin</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“Sin is crouching at the <b>door</b>; it desires you, but you must master it.”</em><br />
— <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Bible’s first mention of <strong>sin</strong></a> — and it has nothing to do with morality. The Hebrew word for sin here is <strong>chatta’th</strong>, meaning <em>to miss the mark</em>. It is a statement about <strong>imaginative error</strong>.</p><p>In Neville's terms, <i><b><a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">sin is the state of consciousness that contradicts your desire</a></b></i>. It is the assumption of lack, fear, or envy — as in Cain, who resents the unseen nature of his brother Abel’s offering.</p><p>The <strong>door</strong> here is not literal. It is the <strong>threshold of inner consent</strong>, just like the door in Song of Solomon and John 10. “Sin crouching at the door” is the <strong>pull of the old self</strong>, the limiting state that begs for your attention.</p><p>But the verse continues:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You may rule over it.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not condemnation. It is empowerment. You are not a victim of your thoughts — you are their master. You choose what passes through the door.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Unified Symbolism: Three Doors, One Law</strong></h2><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 4</strong> — The first door: sin waits, but you can choose differently. The door is <strong>your assumption</strong>; sin is misalignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon 5</strong> — The inner latch: manifestation comes only by <strong>inner consent</strong>. The beloved knocks, but the latch must be lifted from within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John 10</strong> — The outer door: salvation and pasture are found by <strong>consciously entering the right state</strong>. You must walk through the gate of assumption.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Across all three, the pattern is the same: <strong>consciousness must align with desire</strong>, and you must willingly open the threshold of belief. The <strong>door is you</strong> — not a gate in heaven or history, but the line between your <strong>inner identity and its outer reflection</strong>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Neville Goddard’s Perspective: The Inner Mechanics of Manifestation</strong></h2><p>For Neville, manifestation is mechanical but sacred:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>door</strong> is the chosen state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>latch</strong> is the subconscious agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>shepherd</strong> is your inner imagination guiding you to pasture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">Sin</a></strong> is forgetting this — assuming a state unworthy of your true nature.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>David, the beloved shepherd, is not just a figure from ancient texts. He is your <strong>ideal self</strong> — the one who has united both doors and now lives in the pasture of assumed truth.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Final Reflection: “Enter Through Me”</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“I am the door.”</em> — <strong>John 10:9</strong><br />
<em>“You may rule over it.”</em> — <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>These are not contradictory. They are parallel. Jesus is not claiming divine exclusivity — he is speaking the <strong>law of consciousness</strong>: <em>the I AM state is the only gate</em>.</p><p>You enter “through me” — through your own awareness of being. You walk the inner path. You lift the latch. You master sin — misaligned imagination — not by willpower, but by choosing to assume well.</p><p>This is not religion. It is law. And the door is always open.</p>
