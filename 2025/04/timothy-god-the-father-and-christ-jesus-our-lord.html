<h1>Timothy: God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord</h1>
<p>To interpret <em>2 Timothy 1:2</em> through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we consider his central idea: that Scripture is <strong>psychological drama</strong> played out in the human soul, with <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> and <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Christ</a> as states of consciousness within the individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Neville-style interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Timothy</strong> symbolises the <strong>disciple within you</strong> — a newly awakened state of spiritual consciousness or a developing aspect of your inner self that is learning to walk by imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"My beloved child"</strong> reflects a <strong>projection of self</strong>: Paul (the writer) represents the more established spiritual awareness addressing this younger state — an older, more experienced state of consciousness mentoring a newer one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grace</strong> is the <strong>unearned favour</strong> or gift of imagining and creating your world — the realisation that your assumptions harden into fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mercy</strong> is <strong>forgiveness</strong>, which Neville often redefines as <strong>radically changing your inner state</strong>. You don't dwell on the past or 'sin' (missing the mark); instead, you move to a new assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peace</strong> is the <strong>emotional stillness</strong> that comes when you're fully aligned with your desired state — when the inner man is at rest in the assumption that it <em>is so</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>God the Father</strong> refers to <strong>your own I AM</strong> — the divine awareness of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christ Jesus our Lord</strong> symbolises the <strong>power and wisdom of imagination</strong> — the creative act that gives form to your assumptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
This verse, through Neville's lens, is not an external greeting but an internal moment of affirmation — your higher self blessing a newly forming state within you (Timothy) with the tools needed to manifest: grace (creative power), mercy (ability to shift states), and peace (emotional confidence in the unseen).
