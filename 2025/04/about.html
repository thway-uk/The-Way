<h1>About</h1>
One of the most liberating realisations I’ve had is that our true bondage — our “Egypt” — isn’t the world outside us, but the beliefs we hold inside.<p>The Bible has been handed down as literal history, turned into rigid doctrines that <a href="/search/label/Reasons%20to%20Avoid%20the%20Literal%20Bible">demand blind acceptance</a>. Yet its true power lies in its psychological symbolism — a map of states of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">self-perception</a>, guiding you to discover your own creative, <i>generative</i> power.</p><p>Read this way, the <b>Bible immediately and intimately connects you to <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a></b> — not through fear or outer worship, but through <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html"><b>love</b></a>. You realise that the inner movement from bondage to freedom is an emotional and imaginative one, and the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">presence of God</a> is revealed as awareness itself, working in and through <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">your assumption</a>.</p><div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote>“The <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">kingdom of God</a> comes not with observation:<br />Neither shall they say, Look here! Or, look there! for, behold, <i>the kingdom of God is within you</i>.” — Luke 17:20–21 (KJV)</blockquote></div><p>Once you see this, you realise that most of what the world calls “truth” is another layer of bondage. The world insists on external authority, external saviours, and external validation — all designed to keep you from the real source: your <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Beyond tradition</h2><div></div><blockquote><div>“The Lord: “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I bear a child, now that I’m old?’ Is anything too hard for the Lord?”<div>Sarah: “I didn’t laugh.”</div>The Lord: “No, but you did laugh.”</div></blockquote><div></div><p>A psychological reading of the Bible might seem laughable or absurd, or even offensive to those firmly rooted in traditional Christianity. But the Bible itself anticipates this response, through stories like that of <a href="/2025/04/sarahs-laughter-humour-of-manifestation.html">Sarah laughing at the Lord’s promise</a>, and the cynic Shimei, who:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“...kept pace with them on the hillside opposite, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.”</em> —2 Samuel 16:13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scriptures also portray the early stages of the mind attempting to apply the Law of Assumption—often <a href="/search?q=Leviticus">still clinging to ritual and religion</a> as its first approach. If you truly long to understand what the Bible is actually saying, free from inherited interpretations, you’re in the right place. I stumbled into this by accident, having once rejected mainstream readings myself, and it’s been life-changing.</p><p>If you find it challenging to accept, that only reveals how deeply our prior beliefs shape what we’re able to see. </p><p>Much like Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:8—who calls on Daniel for divine insight yet still names him <em>“Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god”</em>—many approach the Bible seeking truth, but through inherited labels and frameworks that distort it. If you come with the assumption that the Bible is about external religion or moral commands, you’ll miss the deeper story Neville revealed: the Bible is a psychological drama, and God is your imagination. And in my personal view, the Bible is the greatest love story ever told, and it's all about you.</p><hr /><h2>Building on Neville’s foundation</h2><p><a href="/search/label/Neville%20Goddard%20Series">Neville Goddard’s</a> teachings show that imagination creates reality, and that scripture, properly understood, is a guide to mastering this inner creative law. Neville's revelation has existed for about 75 years but remains largely overlooked.</p><p>This website builds on his foundation, using modern tools and personal insights to uncover connections even he did not explicitly address.</p><p>Here you will find in-depth articles exploring biblical passages, psychological symbolism, and the practical art of manifestation. This is not for the casually curious — it is for those ready to move beyond external interpretations and step into the true power of “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>.” <a href="/2025/06/only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard’s framework</a>, as presented on this website, helps the reader interpret and connect with any part of the Bible—making it not only accessible but deeply exciting and enjoyable in its true form as the Law of Assumption.</p><p>I am not affiliated with any specific religion — my focus is purely on interpreting the meaning within the text itself. </p><hr /><h2>Welcome</h2><p>If you feel that call, you’re already on the path.
