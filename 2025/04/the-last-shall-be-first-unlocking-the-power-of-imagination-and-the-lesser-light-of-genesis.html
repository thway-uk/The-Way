<h1>The 'Last Shall Be First': Unlocking the Power of Imagination and the 'Lesser Light' of Genesis</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“So the last shall be first, and the first last…”</strong><br />
— <em>Matthew 20:16</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This isn’t about time. It’s not about history. It’s a riddle that reveals the hidden structure of consciousness. Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not literal but symbolic—<strong>a psychological document showing how the unseen world within you becomes the world around you</strong>.</p><p>What appears to be “first” in life—what is visible, factual, and urgent—is not truly first. And what seems “last”—your imagination, your inner assumptions, your silent states of being—is actually <strong>the first cause</strong> of everything you experience.</p><p>This truth is already encoded in the opening lines of Genesis:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night…”</strong><br />
— <em>Genesis 1:16</em></p>
</blockquote><p>What appears to describe the sun and moon is, in Neville’s interpretation, <strong>a symbolic division within consciousness itself</strong>. A division between the declarative and the receptive. The visible and the invisible. The “I Am” and the creative power that shapes it.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Greater Light: “I AM” – The Source of Being</strong></h2><p>The greater light symbolises <strong>your awareness of being</strong>—the origin point of all creation. Before anything is imagined or assumed, you must first <strong>be</strong>. This pure awareness—“<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>”—is the <strong>masculine principle</strong> in symbolic terms. It initiates. It declares. It sets the tone.</p><p>This greater light “rules the day” because it governs your waking consciousness, the place from which you direct thought, assumption, and identity.</p><p>Every affirmation begins here:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM whole</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM free</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I AM unloved</strong> (yes—even the unwanted beliefs begin here)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville taught that this is not ego. This is <strong>God within you</strong>—your foundational identity, from which all else flows.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Lesser Light: Imagination – The Creative Feminine</strong></h2><p>The lesser light is <strong>imagination</strong>—what Neville often called the <strong>creative faculty</strong>. It is the <strong>feminine principle</strong>: receptive, fertile, formative.</p><p>It rules the night because it governs the unseen. It shapes what the “I AM” declares. It accepts the impressions of identity and gives them form in the outer world.</p><p>Neville writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>“The subconscious faithfully reproduces whatever is impressed upon it.”<br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>So while “I AM” is the greater light—the essence—<strong>imagination</strong> is the power that <strong>brings it forth into experience</strong>. It seems “lesser” only because it works in the invisible, but it is no less divine.</p><hr /><h2><strong>From Light to Flesh: The Evolution of Symbolic Division</strong></h2><p>The symbolism of the greater and lesser lights is not isolated—it is the <strong>first movement</strong> in a cascading symbolic structure that runs throughout Scripture.</p><p>Genesis begins with light and dark, greater and lesser. But this principle of division continues:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Heaven and earth</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waters above and below</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Male and female</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“Male and female created He them.” — <em>Genesis 1:27</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These are not disconnected ideas. They are <strong>repeating patterns</strong> that symbolise <strong>the relationship between source and expression</strong>.<br />
The <strong>greater light</strong> becomes the <strong>male principle</strong>. The <strong>lesser light</strong>, the <strong>female</strong>.<br /></p><hr /><h2><strong>“The Last Shall Be First”: The Hidden Becomes Visible</strong></h2><p>So what did Jesus mean by “the last shall be first”?</p><p>It’s not about morality or reward. It’s a revelation of the creative order.</p><blockquote>
<p>What appears “last”—imagination, belief, assumption—is in truth <strong>first in power</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>And what appears “first”—the physical world, the facts of your life—is really <strong>last</strong>, the echo of what was once assumed.</p><p>This is the entire mechanism of manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You imagine a scene (the unseen “last”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You feel it real</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It externalises as fact (becoming “first” in visibility)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The seen is always <strong>the result</strong> of the unseen.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Why You Must Honour the Lesser to Reveal the Greater</strong></h2><p>This is why Neville constantly instructed his readers to <strong>assume the state of the wish fulfilled</strong>—to dare to believe what the world has not yet shown.</p><blockquote>
<p>“An assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”<br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Your current outer life may appear to be “first” in authority—but it is only the <strong>final product</strong> of yesterday’s imagination.</p><p>And what seems small, internal, quiet—the “last”—is the <strong>womb of all creation</strong>. When you honour the lesser light (imagination), you allow the greater light (I AM) to shine through it.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Conclusion: A Divine Pattern Hidden in the Beginning</strong></h2><p>Genesis does not open with physical events—it opens with <strong>symbolic structure</strong>. The greater and lesser lights are not cosmological—they are <strong>psychological</strong>. They show how creation happens:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>“I AM”</strong> (the greater light) declares identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imagination</strong> (the lesser light) conceives it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience</strong> (the visible world) reflects it</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The first is within. The last is without. But the moment you place faith in the inner world—<strong>the last</strong>—you cause it to become <strong>first</strong> in appearance.</p><p>This is the law hidden in Genesis, fulfilled in the Gospels, and demonstrated in you.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live.”<br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p></blockquote>
