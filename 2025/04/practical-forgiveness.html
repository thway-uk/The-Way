<h1>Practical Forgiveness</h1>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...”</p></blockquote><p>The word translated <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">“God” here is <em>Elohim</em></a>, a plural noun meaning “rulers,” “judges,” or “powers.” Neville taught that this reveals a deep truth: there are infinite states of consciousness, and each one can rule your life if you let it.</p><p>When you keep identifying with a certain state — for example, seeing yourself as hurt, wronged, or limited — you uphold that state as a “judge” in your mind. You continually manifest it because you keep returning to it in <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self-perception</a>.</p><p>Forgiveness, as Neville explained, is not about excusing someone else. It is about no longer letting the <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">old state rule you</a>. You stop reacting from it. You forget it completely and return to your original creative image: the pure “I AM,” before any reaction or story.</p><p>This is how you claim dominion, as Genesis 1:26 says. Genesis 4:4-7 says you are not meant to be ruled by past states; you are meant to rule over them. When you forgive, you take back that dominion. You drop the old judge and assume a new state — the one that matches your desire.</p><p>In this way, <i>God</i> is not about an external God but about the many states governing you. Every state you occupy acts as a ruler until you choose another. By forgiving, you remove the old ruler and put on the new, and your world faithfully reflects this inner change.</p>
