<h1>Deuteronomy 32:4 — "He Is The Rock"</h1>
<p><strong>"He is the Rock, His work is perfect: for all His ways are <a href="/2025/05/judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">judgment</a>: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He."</strong></p><hr /><p>This verse doesn’t describe a remote being in the sky. In the spiritual framework of Neville Goddard, it defines a principle within you — <strong>Imagination itself</strong>. The Rock is not an external saviour, but the <em>solid, immovable foundation</em> of consciousness.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"He is the Rock"</strong><br />
In Neville’s language: <strong>“Your own wonderful human imagination is God.”</strong><br />
The “Rock” is the firm awareness of being — unshakeable, dependable, always present. It is the <em>truth</em> you stand on when you declare, <em><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><blockquote>
<p><strong>"His work is perfect"</strong><br />
Imagination does not fail. Every event in your world reflects a perfect outworking of inner states. Not perfect in terms of moral judgement — but perfect in <strong>law</strong>.<br />
What you assume, you experience. What you persist in, hardens into fact.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><blockquote>
<p><strong>"All His ways are judgment"</strong><br />
Every assumption made is followed by its consequences. This is judgment in motion — not punishment, but the unfolding of imaginal activity.<br />
It’s not that a God in the sky is weighing decisions, but that <strong>consciousness itself operates by principle</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><blockquote>
<p><strong>"A God of truth and without iniquity"</strong><br />
Imagination doesn’t lie. It gives to each according to what they accept as true.<br />
There is no “iniquity” in it — no unfairness. The Law is impartial. What you sow in imagination, you reap in form.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><blockquote>
<p><strong>"Just and right is He"</strong><br />
The God within is <strong>just</strong> because the Law does not change depending on the person. It responds to <strong>belief</strong>.<br />
It is <a href="/2025/05/judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">right</a> because it mirrors what you are — not what you wish, but what you <em>accept as real</em>.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Deuteronomy 32:4, through Neville’s interpretation, becomes a celebration of the <strong>lawful, faithful activity of imagination</strong>. It invites you to recognise the Rock within — the unchanging power of consciousness — and to build your life deliberately upon it.</p>
