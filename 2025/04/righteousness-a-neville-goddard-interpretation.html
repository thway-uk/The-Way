<h1>Righteousness: A Neville Goddard Interpretation</h1>
<p>Righteousness is a concept frequently mentioned in the Bible, but Neville Goddard offers a <strong>unique perspective</strong> that shifts it from a rigid, moral framework to a more <strong>dynamic and creative force</strong>. In this post, we explore Neville’s interpretation of righteousness and how it aligns with the idea of <strong>living in harmony with your creative power</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h4>What is Righteousness According to Neville Goddard?</h4>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that <strong>righteousness</strong> is <strong>a correction in our imagination</strong> that makes things right, as we want them to be. It's not about following a set of rules or laws; rather, it's about <strong>living from a state of inner knowing</strong> that you are the creator of your reality, and that <strong>your thoughts and beliefs shape your world</strong>.</p>
<p>In Neville's view, righteousness is simply the <strong>right use of imagination</strong>—knowing that everything you experience is the result of your inner thoughts, assumptions, and feelings. When your imagination is aligned with your desired outcome, you are living righteously because you're correcting the false beliefs or assumptions that once held you back.</p>

<h4>Key Bible Verses and Neville’s Interpretation</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 5:6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."<br />
Neville Goddard interprets this verse as the desire for <strong>alignment with the creative power</strong> of the universe. Those who seek to understand and harness their imagination for <strong>good</strong>—for creating the life they desire—will find that they are fulfilled and empowered.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Romans 3:22</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."<br />
For Neville, <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> represents the <strong>imagination</strong> within each of us. To live righteously is to live in <strong>faith in your own creative abilities</strong>, trusting that your thoughts and imagination create your external reality. It’s not faith in a distant figure, but faith in your own power to manifest change.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:33</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."<br />
Neville explains that the "kingdom" refers to the <strong>inner world</strong> of your consciousness. <strong>Righteousness</strong> is found when you <strong>align your thoughts with your desired outcome</strong>, trusting that this will bring everything you need into your life. It's a call to manifest from a place of inner clarity and purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Romans 8:4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."<br />
Neville views this as a shift from <strong>external living (flesh)</strong> to <strong>internal living (Spirit)</strong>. To live righteously is to live <strong>from the Spirit of your imagination</strong>—to understand that your thoughts are the driving force in your life, and when you align with this, you live according to <strong>higher laws</strong> of creation, not external circumstances.</p>

<h4>Righteousness as Imagination</h4>
<p>According to Neville, <strong>righteousness is the proper use of imagination</strong>—it’s <strong>a correction in our imagination</strong> that makes things right, as we want them to be. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Living from the assumption of your desired state</strong>: Assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trusting your inner world</strong>: Understanding that your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings directly influence your outer reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manifesting through faith</strong>: Believing in the unseen and realising that <strong>your inner world shapes the outer world</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Righteousness, as interpreted by Neville Goddard, isn't about adhering to external rules or standards. It’s about <strong>correcting your imagination</strong> and aligning it with the creative power of the universe. By <strong>living from the right assumptions</strong>, you are creating your desired reality and bringing your life into harmony with your true desires.</p>
<p>Through understanding and harnessing this power, you align yourself with <strong>righteous living</strong> and create the life you truly desire.</p>
<p>Embrace righteousness as the <strong>right use of imagination</strong>, and see how your world begins to transform.</p>
