<h1>Why So Many Biblical Names End in “El” – A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever spent time reading through the Bible—especially the Old Testament—you may have noticed something curious: <strong>a lot of names end in “el.”</strong> Names like <em>Daniel, Gabriel, Samuel, Ezekiel,</em> and <em>Emmanuel</em>. This isn’t a coincidence or just a quirk of ancient languages. From the mystical lens of <strong>Neville Goddard’s teachings</strong>, this pattern reveals something deeply profound.</p><h3>The Hidden Power of “El”</h3><p>In Hebrew, <strong>“El” means God</strong>. It's one of the oldest names used for the Divine, and it forms the foundation of many compound names in the Bible. But Neville Goddard, who taught that the Bible is not historical but <em>psychological</em>, would urge us to look deeper.</p><p>To Neville, <strong>God is not a man in the sky</strong>—not some external force judging you from above. God is <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. Every reference to God in the Bible, including “El,” is a reference to your <strong>I AM</strong>, the awareness of being, the creative power that shapes your reality from within.</p><p>So when you see “El” in a name, it’s not just a suffix—it’s a reminder that <strong>the power of God is embedded in that name</strong>, and by extension, within <em>you</em>.</p><h3>Names as States of Consciousness</h3><p>Neville taught that the characters and names in scripture are not people, but <strong>states of consciousness</strong>. These names point to qualities and aspects of the Divine that you can embody. They're symbolic of what you become when you align with your true creative nature.</p><p>Let’s break down some of the most well-known “el” names and discover the deeper message they hold:</p><hr /><h3><strong>Divine Name Meanings</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Daniel</strong> – <em>“God is my judge”</em><br />
Represents a state where you look inward for truth. Your imagination—not the opinions of the world—is your true judge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Samuel</strong> – <em>“Heard by God”</em><br />
Symbolizes the idea that your <strong>inner speech is heard</strong> by your imagination, and therefore has the power to create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ishmael</strong> – <em>“God hears”</em><br />
Reinforces the truth that <strong>every word you speak internally</strong> is heard and responded to by your subconscious—the God within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gabriel</strong> – <em>“God is my strength”</em><br />
A state of inner strength, where divine inspiration (ideas) are born from within and carry you through any challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> – <em>“Who is like God?”</em><br />
A rhetorical question emphasizing that <strong>there is nothing like your I AM</strong>—your imagination is unparalleled in power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Raphael</strong> – <em>“God heals”</em><br />
Represents the healing ability of <strong>revising past events</strong> and transforming the present through imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel</strong> – <em>“God will strengthen”</em><br />
The state of being supported by divine force, especially when appearances suggest otherwise. Strength comes from <strong>within</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nathaniel</strong> – <em>“Gift of God”</em><br />
Symbolizes the realization that <strong>your desires and manifestations</strong> are divine gifts born of your I AM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uriel</strong> – <em>“God is my light”</em><br />
The inner illumination, insight, and guidance you receive when you trust your imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emmanuel</strong> – <em>“God is with us”</em><br />
Not a person walking beside you, but the truth that <strong>your own creative power never leaves you</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elijah</strong> – <em>“My God is Yah (I AM)”</em><br />
A declaration of identity. Elijah is the embodiment of someone who fully understands and lives from the <strong>truth of I AM</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bethel</strong> – <em>“House of God”</em><br />
Not a place, but a <strong>mental dwelling</strong>. When your thoughts are aligned with your desires, your imagination becomes the true house of God.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>The Bigger Picture</h3><p>So why do so many names end in "el"? Because these names are <strong>living reminders</strong>. They speak to the truth Neville so often taught:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“God became man that man may become God.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These names are not historical records of long-dead men. They’re <strong>archetypes</strong>, whispering truths about you. They reflect the many faces of God—not in heaven, but in you. When you walk through the states these names represent, you're awakening to your creative power, step by step.</p><p>The Bible, when viewed through Neville’s eyes, becomes <strong>a mirror</strong>—showing you not the world outside, but the world <em>within</em>. And “El” is the signature at the bottom of every page, reminding you:</p><p><strong>You are divine. You are imagination. You are I AM.</strong></p><p><br /></p>
