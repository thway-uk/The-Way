<h1>Doors: Neville Goddard’s Interpretation</h1>
<p>Before exploring Neville Goddard’s teaching about the door as a gateway to new states of consciousness, it is illuminating to consider the earliest biblical appearance of the word <strong>sin</strong> in <strong>Genesis 4:7</strong> — <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">where sin is described</a> as “waiting at the door.” This verse profoundly ties the concept of the door to the spiritual and psychological condition of the individual.</p><blockquote>
<p>"If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must rule over it."<br />
— Genesis 4:7 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, sin is not simply a moral failing or external judgment but a <strong>state of misalignment</strong> — what the Hebrew word <em>chatta’th</em> means literally: “missing the mark.”</p><p>This verse symbolises the <strong>door as the threshold where choice occurs</strong>: Will you align with your higher imagination — your inner Abel — or will you fall prey to the outer man’s egoic anger and envy — your inner Cain?</p><hr /><h3>Dalet: The Door as Symbol of Transition and Mastery</h3><p>Connecting this to the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet</a>, the letter <strong>dalet (ד)</strong> means “door,” representing the <strong>gateway between bondage and freedom, ignorance and awareness</strong>. Genesis 4:7’s “sin crouching at the door” is a vivid metaphor: just as the letter dalet stands at the threshold of the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet’s</a> spiritual teachings, sin crouches at the threshold of your consciousness, waiting for your permission to enter.</p><p>You hold the power — the <strong>key of your imagination</strong> — to <strong>open or close that door</strong>. You may “rule over” sin by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, which Neville defines as the essence of creation.</p><hr /><h3>The Door as a Place of Spiritual Conflict and Victory</h3><p>This idea of sin “waiting at the door” mirrors Neville’s concept of consciousness creating reality through the Law of Assumption. Sin is the assumption of defeat, lack, jealousy, or misalignment. It “knocks,” seeking to enter your consciousness and control your experience.</p><p>But the door also represents <strong>invitation and opportunity</strong>. When you <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">consciously “open the door” with faith and imaginative assumption</a>, you allow the presence of your fulfilled desire to enter.</p><p>Neville’s teachings encourage you to be the master at this threshold — to recognise the power of your choice and to persist in the assumption that honours your true creative self.</p><hr /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div>The name <i>David</i> means “<b>beloved</b>” and contains two Hebrew letters dalet (ד), which symbolize doors or thresholds. This doubling emphasizes <a href="/2025/04/davids-name-and-law-of-conscious.html">David as a gateway figure</a>—the beloved one, as the ideal,new young assumption in action and personified. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, David represents the awakening of the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">heart’s desire</a> and the manifestation of love as a creative force, inviting us to open the inner doors that lead to the reality we truly desire.</div><h3>Summary: The Door as a Symbol of Choice Between Alignment and Misalignment</h3><table>

</table><hr /><h3>Bringing It Together: From Genesis 4:7 to Neville’s Door</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>The biblical “door” is the <strong>psychological threshold</strong> where you choose your inner state — misaligned egoic Cain or aligned imaginal Abel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hebrew dalet reminds us that this door is a deliberate passage — one of assumption and transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that by <strong>assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, you actively open this door to your desired reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like the warning in Genesis 4:7, you <strong>may rule over what “waits at the door”</strong> — whether fear, doubt, or limiting beliefs — by choosing the inner state that creates and manifests your dreams.</p></li></ul>
