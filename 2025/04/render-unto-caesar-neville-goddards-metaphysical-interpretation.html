<h1>Render Unto Caesar: Neville Goddard’s Metaphysical Interpretation</h1>
<p>The phrase <em>“Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s”</em> (Matthew 22:21) is one of the most quoted lines in the New Testament. On the surface, it sounds like a simple call to obey civil authorities. But metaphysical teacher Neville Goddard saw something much deeper hidden in these words.</p>
<p>To Neville, the Bible is not just a historical document or a book of religious rules—it is a psychological drama playing out within the human imagination. Every character, place, and event symbolizes something happening inside of you. When he read Jesus’ response about Caesar, Neville wasn’t thinking about taxes—he was thinking about the balance between the <em>outer world of facts</em> and the <em>inner world of imagination</em>.</p>
<h3>Caesar and the World of Facts</h3>
<p>When Jesus says, <em>“Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,”</em> Neville interprets Caesar as a symbol of the external world—the realm of physical evidence, logic, and appearances. It is the domain of the five senses. You pay your bills, follow the laws, deal with circumstances. That’s Caesar’s world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While you’re living in this world, you do what you must do. But you don’t worship Caesar.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Supporting verse:</strong><br />
<em>“The things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</em> — 2 Corinthians 4:18</p>
<p>This verse supports Neville’s point: what is seen—what belongs to Caesar—is temporary. It changes. It fades. But there is another realm, one that shapes the seen world.</p>
<h3>God and the Power of Imagination</h3>
<p>Neville taught that <em>God is your own wonderful human imagination</em>. To <em>render unto God</em> means to give your attention, faith, and energy to the unseen creative power within you. Imagination is the real force that creates your life’s circumstances. If you give God what is God’s—meaning, your inner devotion and belief—then what belongs to Caesar will eventually be transformed.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting verse:</strong><br />
<em>“God calleth those things which be not as though they were.”</em> — Romans 4:17<br />
This echoes Neville’s teaching: assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and your inner state will eventually be reflected in the outer world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Facts do not matter. Circumstances do not matter. Imagination creates reality.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Living Between Two Worlds</h3>
<p>Neville didn’t teach us to deny reality or live in delusion. He said to respect the world of Caesar—pay what’s due, acknowledge facts—but do not <em>bow down</em> to them. The real power lies within you. If the facts contradict your desire, do not fight them—simply go within and revise, imagine, and believe.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting verse:</strong><br />
<em>“Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.”</em> — Romans 12:2</p>
<p>Transformation doesn’t come by changing Caesar directly. It comes by renewing your mind—using imagination to assume a new state of being.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When Neville said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, he was really reminding us not to be ruled by appearances. You can live in the world, but you don’t have to be shaped by it. You shape it.</p>
<p>Honor the facts, but worship the creative power of God—your imagination. That’s the path to real change.</p>
