<h1>I Love The Lord: A Divine Dialogue with Consciousness and Imagination</h1>
<p><strong>Psalm 116</strong> is a deeply moving expression of gratitude, love, and reflection, but when interpreted through the lens of <strong>Neville Goddard’s teachings</strong>, it becomes an even more profound map for understanding the process of <strong>manifestation</strong>. Reading the psalm from the perspective of <strong>David</strong>—whose name means “beloved”—transforms it into a narrative of the <strong>inner journey of manifestation</strong>, where the <strong>Lord</strong> represents <strong>consciousness</strong> and the <strong>imagination</strong> is the creative force through which we shape reality.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s philosophy, the Bible is not a historical or external account but a guide to understanding the deep inner workings of our consciousness. <strong>Psalm 116</strong>, when read from the perspective of David (the beloved), reveals the steps of <strong>manifestation</strong>: the transition from longing to fulfilment, guided by the power of our inner imagination.</p><p>Let’s dive into the psalm and explore how it reflects the <strong>journey of manifestation</strong>—with David as the embodiment of the <strong>fulfilled desire</strong> and the <strong>imagination</strong> as the tool of creation.</p><h3><strong>Psalm 116: The Psalm in Its Entirety (BBE Translation)</strong></h3><p>Here is <strong>Psalm 116</strong> in the <strong>BBE (Bible in Basic English)</strong> translation:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>I have love for the Lord, because he has given ear to the voice of my prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because he has turned his ear to me, I will send up my prayer to him all my days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cords of death were round me, and the pains of hell came on me: I was in trouble and sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I made a prayer to the Lord, O Lord, take my soul out of trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gracious is the Lord, and upright; and our God is full of mercy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lord keeps the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come back to your rest, O my soul; for the Lord has been good to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For you have taken my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will go before the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had faith, for this reason I said, I am greatly troubled:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I said in my fear, Every man is false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will I give to the Lord for all his benefits to me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will make my offerings to the Lord in the presence of all his people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The death of his saints is dear in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Lord, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, and the son of your handmaid: you have let loose my chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will make an offering of praise to you, and give praise to the name of the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will make my offerings to the Lord in the presence of all his people,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the house of the Lord, in the middle of Jerusalem. Praise be to the Lord.</p>

David, as the <strong>beloved</strong>, symbolises the <strong>desired manifestation</strong>, and the <strong>Lord</strong> is our <strong>imagination</strong> and <strong>consciousness</strong>. The psalm is not an external plea to a higher power but an internal dialogue, reflecting the <strong>steps</strong> in manifesting our desires.</p><h4>1. <strong>David as the Manifestation of Desire</strong></h4><p>David, whose name means <strong>beloved</strong>, embodies the <strong>desired manifestation</strong>—the fulfilment of inner desires made real. When David speaks, he represents the <strong>assumed state of being</strong> that has already been realised.</p><h5>"I have love for the Lord, because he has given ear to the voice of my prayer."</h5><p>Here, David (the <strong>manifestation</strong>) acknowledges that the <strong>Lord</strong> (the <strong>imagination</strong>) has <strong>heard</strong> and <strong>responded</strong> to his desires. In Neville Goddard’s philosophy, this is the moment when we align our desires with our imagination and bring them into our <strong>consciousness</strong>, causing them to manifest.</p><h4>2. <strong>Seeking Assistance: Turning Inward</strong></h4><p>David’s cry for help reflects the <strong>call to consciousness</strong> (imagination) when we feel stuck in undesirable circumstances.</p><h5>"Then I made a prayer to the Lord, O Lord, take my soul out of trouble."</h5><p>David, in his moment of challenge, calls upon the <strong>Lord</strong> (imagination), asking for deliverance. This represents our ability to <strong>shift our inner state</strong> and consciously direct our thoughts and beliefs to bring about transformation in our outer world.</p><h4>3. <strong>The Fulfilled Manifestation: The Beloved is Set Free</strong></h4><p>David’s deliverance symbolises the <strong>manifestation</strong> becoming a reality. The <strong>manifested desire</strong> (David) experiences the <strong>fruits of imagination</strong>.</p><h5>"For you have taken my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling."</h5><p>Here, David (the <strong>beloved</strong>) is fully experiencing the transformation, as his soul is <strong>saved</strong> and his life is changed. This moment reflects the <strong>realisation of the desired state</strong>: <strong>manifestation</strong> is now fully realised through the power of imagination.</p><h4>4. <strong>Faith in the Unseen: The Power of Belief</strong></h4><p>David’s <strong>faith</strong> speaks to the essential role of <strong>belief</strong> in Neville Goddard’s teachings, where belief precedes manifestation.</p><h5>"I had faith, for this reason I said, I am greatly troubled."</h5><p>Even in the midst of external turmoil, <strong>David</strong> (the <strong>manifestation</strong>) has <strong>faith</strong> that the inner work (imagination and assumption) will lead to the desired outcome. Neville often taught that <strong>faith</strong> in the <strong>unseen</strong> is the cornerstone of manifestation.</p><h4>5. <strong>Gratitude and Acknowledgment: Paying Our Vows</strong></h4><p>David acknowledges that his transformation has come through the <strong>power of imagination</strong>.</p><h5>"What will I give to the Lord for all his benefits to me?"</h5><p>This verse reflects <strong>gratitude</strong> for the <strong>imagination's role</strong> in bringing the desire into the material world. Neville Goddard emphasised that gratitude is a <strong>powerful tool</strong> in reinforcing the belief in our ability to create.</p><h4>6. <strong>David’s Vows and Offerings: Acknowledging the Inner Power</strong></h4><p>Finally, David’s vow to offer <strong>praise</strong> and <strong>thanksgiving</strong> speaks to the idea of acknowledging the <strong>inner power</strong> (imagination) that has transformed his life.</p><h5>"I will make my offerings to the Lord in the presence of all his people."</h5><p>David now understands that the <strong>Lord</strong> (the reader's <strong>imagination</strong>) is the source of all that has been manifested. This represents our ongoing <strong>relationship</strong> with our own inner creative power and the importance of expressing <strong>gratitude</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: David as the Symbol of Manifestation</strong></h3><p>By reading <strong>Psalm 116</strong> as the voice of <strong>David</strong> (the <strong>beloved</strong>), we uncover the deeper process of <strong>manifestation</strong> through the power of <strong>consciousness</strong> and <strong>imagination</strong>. David represents the <strong>desired manifestation</strong>, and his journey through the psalm parallels the <strong>steps</strong> we take when manifesting desires: from <strong>prayer</strong> and <strong>belief</strong> to <strong>realisation</strong> and <strong>gratitude</strong>.</p><p>This psalm, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, reminds us that we are the <strong>creators</strong> of our reality. The <strong>Lord</strong> (our <strong>imagination</strong>) listens to the voice of our desires, responds to our inner assumptions, and brings forth the manifestations we align with. By embodying the principles in <strong>Psalm 116</strong>, we can navigate our own process of manifestation, understanding that the <strong>beloved</strong> (the desired outcome) is within us and can be realised through the <strong>power of consciousness and imagination</strong>.</p><p><br /></p>
