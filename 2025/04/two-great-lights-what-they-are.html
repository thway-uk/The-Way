<h1>Two Great Lights: What They Are</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>“And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night...”</em><br />
— <em>Genesis 1:16</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, these two lights are not celestial bodies alone—but symbols of the <strong>two aspects of your mind</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Light: The Conscious Mind</strong></h3>
<p>The greater light symbolises the <strong>conscious mind</strong>—the part of you that imagines, chooses, and directs. It rules the “day” because it brings clarity, intention, and active awareness.</p>
<h3><strong>Lesser Light: The Subconscious Mind</strong></h3>
<p>The lesser light represents the <strong>subconscious</strong>—not passive, but <strong>receptive</strong>. Just as the moon reflects the sun, the subconscious reflects the impressions it receives from the conscious mind. It rules the “night”, the unseen space where ideas take root.</p>
<h3><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h3>
<p>This verse reminds us that <strong>manifestation is a collaboration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The conscious mind plants the seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subconscious nurtures and brings it forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neville taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The subconscious is what you are; the conscious is what you know.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while the lesser light may seem “lesser”, it holds the <strong>power of creation</strong>. Treat it with reverence—<strong>impress it wisely</strong>.</p>
