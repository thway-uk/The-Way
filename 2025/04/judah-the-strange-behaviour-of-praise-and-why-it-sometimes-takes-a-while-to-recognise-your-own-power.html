<h1>Judah: The Strange Behaviour of Praise (and Why It Sometimes Takes a While to Recognise Your Own Power)</h1>
<p>We’re told that Judah means <em>praise, </em>or<em> "to be praised" </em>to be exact. Sounds uplifting, doesn’t it? You’d expect him to come bursting onto the scene with harps, hallelujahs, and hands lifted to the sky.</p><p>Instead, we get a man who sells his brother, disappears from his family, makes questionable decisions, and fails to keep a promise.<br />
Praise?</p><p>Neville Goddard would raise an eyebrow—and then smile knowingly. Because Judah’s journey isn’t about public worship. It’s about <em>the recognition of your own creative power</em>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>When Praise Forgets Where It Came From</strong></h3><p>Judah “went down from his brethren.” Not just a location shift—it’s a symbolic descent. Praise, or the acknowledgment of the creative process, detaches from awareness. It forgets the seed it planted.</p><p>He mingles with Canaanites. He lives externally. He promises his son to Tamar and breaks that promise. Meanwhile, the subconscious (Tamar) waits. And waits. Until the moment is ripe.</p><p>Neville would say this is what happens when imagination (the true creative power) goes unrecognised. You assume, then forget. You plant, then panic. Praise becomes absent, scattered—too distracted to remember that <em>you</em> are the cause.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Recognition Is the Real Praise</strong></h3><p>Tamar doesn't rage. She doesn’t scream. She simply presents the evidence: the signet, the cord, the staff.</p><p>And Judah finally speaks—not in worship, but in <em>recognition</em>.<br />
<em>“She hath been more righteous than I.”</em><br />
Translation? <em>“That was me. I created this. I didn't know it at the time, but this is the return of my own seed.”</em></p><p>In Neville’s framework, that is <em>true praise</em>. Not external performance, but internal acknowledgement. You stop blaming the world. You recognise imagination as the only cause—and <em>you recognise yourself as its centre</em>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Power Is in the Moment You Realise: “This Is Mine”</strong></h3><p>Judah didn’t set out to be a hero. But his line carries forward the breakthrough (<em>Perez</em>). That’s what real praise does. It produces something. It shifts the narrative. It gives birth to transformation—not when you're perfect, but when you’re <em>aware</em>.</p><p>Because in Neville’s world, praise isn’t noise—it’s knowing.<br />
And sometimes, the most powerful form of praise sounds like this:</p><p><em>“Oh... I imagined this. I created this. I didn’t realise it then, but now I see—this is mine.”</em></p>
