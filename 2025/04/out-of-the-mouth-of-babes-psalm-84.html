<h1>Out of the Mouth of Babes: Psalm 8:4</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>What is man, that you are mindful of him? And the son of man, that you visit him?</em><br />
— <em>Psalm 8:4</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Psalm 8 is often read as a hymn of praise to the greatness of God and the smallness of man—but Neville Goddard saw it quite differently. To Neville, <strong><a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> is not small at all</strong>. In fact, <strong><a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> is the means through which <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> expresses Himself</strong>. The psalm, when read symbolically, reveals a powerful truth: <strong>your imagination is divine</strong>, and you are not separate from God—you are His embodiment in form.</p><hr /><h3><strong>"O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth!"</strong></h3><p>In Neville's teachings, the "name" of God is not a label—it is <strong>consciousness itself</strong>. God’s name is <strong>“I AM.”</strong> Wherever someone declares, “I am,” God is there, speaking through that individual awareness.</p><p>So when the psalm says <em>“How excellent is your name”</em>, it is really saying:<br />
<strong>How magnificent is this power of I AM—this awareness of being—in every part of life.</strong></p><hr /><h3><strong>"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings..."</strong></h3><p>Neville would suggest that this line speaks to the <strong>creative purity of the imagination</strong>. Babes and sucklings haven’t yet learned to doubt. They accept what they imagine without question. It is from this state of childlike faith—<strong>a pure, undivided assumption</strong>—that real power flows.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Unless you become as little children, you shall not enter the kingdom.”<br />
— Neville frequently quoted this to highlight the necessity of childlike faith.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>What Does "Childlike" Faith Really Mean?</strong></h3><p>The idea of being “childlike” is central to Neville Goddard’s teachings, and it’s not about <strong>naivety</strong> or <strong>immaturity</strong>. Instead, it speaks to a <strong>mental state of purity, trust, and unquestioning belief</strong>. Neville often explained that children are <strong>unencumbered by doubt</strong>, meaning that they don’t filter their desires through the lens of what’s possible or logical.</p><p>To approach life with <strong>childlike faith</strong> means:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complete Trust in Your Imagination</strong><br />
Just as a child imagines and believes in the possibility of anything—whether it’s a fairy tale, a superhero, or a dream world—<strong>you must learn to trust the power of your imagination</strong> without hesitation or fear. You are not wondering how it will happen; you simply know it will, because you’ve assumed it as true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence of Doubt</strong><br />
Children believe in things without asking <em>“How?”</em> or <em>“When?”</em> When they dream of something, they do not doubt its possibility. They <strong>accept their assumptions as reality</strong>, and this undivided faith in their imagination is why they can create worlds of wonder. Similarly, you must learn to <strong>doubt your doubts</strong> and assume that what you desire <strong>already is</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purity of Assumption</strong><br />
Children are not bogged down by past experiences or preconceived limitations. They hold their assumptions freely and purely, unclouded by the external world. In this way, <strong>childlike faith</strong> is a reminder to return to that <strong>pure, undiluted assumption</strong> that whatever you desire is already yours.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr /><h3><strong>The Cherubim: Symbolising Childlike Faith</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, the <strong>cherubim</strong> serve as a powerful representation of <strong>childlike faith</strong>. These angelic beings, often depicted as pure, innocent, and untainted by doubt, are perfect symbols of the kind of imagination and trust Neville spoke about. The cherubim represent the <strong>unwavering, unquestioning trust in divine imagination</strong>, which is key to manifesting our desires.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Guardians of the Creative Power</strong><br />
The cherubim often <strong>guard sacred spaces</strong>—for example, the entrance to the Garden of Eden or the Ark of the Covenant. This imagery aligns with the need to <strong>guard</strong> your imagination with purity. Just as the cherubim stand watch over the divine, your mind must be protected from doubt and external negativity in order to use your imagination as a powerful creative tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Divine Alignment and Trust</strong><br />
The cherubim are often depicted as being in <strong>close proximity to God</strong>, signifying their alignment with divine consciousness. Neville taught that your imagination is <strong>your connection to the divine</strong>, and the cherubim remind you that this connection is <strong>pure</strong>, <strong>innocent</strong>, and <strong>trusting</strong>. When you embrace a childlike faith, you align yourself with the higher creative power within you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Protection of Innocence</strong><br />
Just as the cherubim protect sacred spaces, they can be seen as protecting the <strong>innocence of your imagination</strong>, which must remain free from external influences, conditioning, and doubt. The more you adopt a <strong>childlike attitude</strong>—one that trusts in the power of your assumptions—the more you will <strong>manifest</strong> from this pure, untainted creative source.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr /><h3><strong>"What is man, that you are mindful of him?"</strong></h3><p>This isn’t a lament—it’s a revelation. Man is the <strong>means of God’s self-expression</strong>. You, the individual, are <strong>not a passive observer in the cosmos</strong>. You are the vessel through which the infinite imagines, feels, and creates.</p><p>Neville would say: God became man so that man might awaken as God.<br />
This verse becomes a profound recognition:<br />
<strong>You are not an afterthought—you are the thought of God itself, wrapped in form.</strong></p><hr /><h3><strong>"You have made him a little lower than the angels..."</strong></h3><p>In Hebrew, this actually reads *“You have made him a little lower than Elohim”—*a word often translated as “God” or “the gods.” In Neville’s view, man is not subordinate to angels but made <strong>just below the fullness of God</strong>, clothed in limitation temporarily—yet still divine.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Man is God dreaming he is man.”<br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>"You have crowned him with glory and honour."</strong></h3><p>This is not future tense. It’s a statement of fact.<br />
You have been <strong>crowned already</strong>—with the power of imagination, the gift of assumption, and the creative nature of I AM.</p><p>The question is not whether you possess divine power, but whether you will recognise it—and use it consciously.</p><hr /><h3><strong>"You made him to have dominion..."</strong></h3><p>Neville taught that dominion is not over other people or animals, but over <strong>your inner world</strong>.<br />
You are the <strong>operant power</strong>. What you accept as true becomes your reality. You are the ruler of your mental kingdom.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Majesty of the Human Imagination</strong></h3><p>Psalm 8 is not about how small you are beneath a mighty God. It is a song of awe—not at your weakness, but at your <strong>creative capacity</strong>.</p><p>It says, in effect:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>How wonderful is man—that God would clothe Himself in him. That I AM could become you, and feel through you, and create through you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville would say: Praise is not flattery. It is <strong>recognition of truth</strong>. And the truth is:<br />
<strong>You are the vessel of God’s own imagining.</strong> You are crowned. You are capable. You are divine.</p><hr /><p>By embodying <strong>childlike faith</strong>, symbolised by the cherubim, you return to the core of your creative power—undistracted by doubt, unwavering in your assumptions, and full of trust that <strong>what you imagine is already real</strong>. This is the essence of <strong>manifestation</strong>: the complete acceptance of your own divinity, and the recognition that, through imagination, you can shape your world.</p><p><br /></p>
