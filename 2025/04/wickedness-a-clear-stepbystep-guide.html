<h1>Wickedness: A Clear, Step‑by‑Step Guide</h1>
<p>Wickedness is often described in the Bible as <strong>rebellion against God</strong> or <strong>moral corruption</strong>, but Neville Goddard shows us that it’s really about <strong>how we use our imagination</strong>. Below is a straightforward look at wickedness—first from the Bible’s standpoint, then through Neville’s lens—with <strong>every key point</strong> included.</p><hr /><h4>1. What the Bible Says About Wickedness</h4><p><strong>1.1 Wickedness as Rebellion Against God</strong><br />
Living against God’s guidance leads to trouble:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalm 1:1–6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked…”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 3:11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him…”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>1.2 Wickedness as Inner Corruption</strong><br />
Wickedness starts in the heart—our beliefs and attitudes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 17:9</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The heart is deceitful above all things…”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 6:16–19</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are six things that the Lord hates… haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood…”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>1.3 The Fate of the Wicked</strong><br />
Wrong choices lead to self‑destruction:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalm 11:6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Upon the wicked he will rain coals of fire; fire and brimstone… shall be the portion of their cup.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h4>2. Neville Goddard’s Fresh Take on Wickedness</h4><p>Neville teaches that <strong>imagination</strong> is God’s gift—and when misused, it creates suffering (wickedness).</p><p><strong>2.1 Wickedness = Negative Imagination</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“Imagination is God in action. If you use it for good, you create a wonderful life. If you use it for evil, you create a life of suffering.”<br />
—Neville Goddard, <em>The Power of Imagination</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Wickedness happens when we imagine fear, lack, or failure and bring those experiences into being. <strong>Wickedness is not an inherent trait in the person</strong>, but rather the <strong>misuse of imagination</strong>. It arises when we <strong>imagine</strong> false, negative, or harmful things instead of aligning with our creative power.</p><p><strong>2.2 Wickedness = Assuming Negative States</strong><br />
Whatever we <strong>assume</strong> to be true, we live out.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Believing we’ll fail or are unworthy guarantees those outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>: negative assumptions = negative results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wickedness, then, is not about being inherently bad; it is about imagining the worst or being misaligned with our divine creative potential.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>2.3 Wickedness = Rejecting Your Creative Power</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>“You are the creator of your world. The moment you accept that, you will stop living a life of wickedness.”<br />
—Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>Refusing to believe in your own imaginative power is itself an act of wickedness. When we deny the <strong>creative power</strong> within, we start imagining failure, struggle, and lack, rather than success and abundance.</p><p><strong>2.4 Wickedness = Forcing Outcomes</strong><br />
When we feel powerless, we try to <strong>make things happen</strong> by force:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 28:22</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth…”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 17:20</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you have faith… you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p>Forcing results shows lack of trust in imagination; faith and ease replace force. Instead of pushing for things to happen, we must align with our imagination and trust that the desired outcome will come to fruition.</p><p><strong>2.5 Realigning with Creative Power</strong><br />
Wickedness ends when we <strong>assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>, trusting that our imagination naturally brings our desires to life. This is the antidote to wickedness: using our imagination to assume the <strong>good and positive</strong> outcomes we want, rather than focusing on the negative.</p><hr /><h4>3. The Heart (Subconscious) and Transformation</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical “heart”</strong> = seat of motives and desires (Jer 17:9 warns of its deceit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s “heart”</strong> = <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, storing our core beliefs and assumptions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To overcome wickedness, we must <strong>rewrite</strong> the subconscious by:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying</strong> limiting beliefs (fear, lack, doubt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replacing</strong> them with positive, creative assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling</strong> the desired outcome as already real—<strong>living in the end</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr /><h3>Key Takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biblical view</strong>: Wickedness is rebellion, moral decay, and self‑destruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville’s view</strong>: Wickedness is the <strong>negative use of imagination</strong>—fearful assumptions, rejection of creative power, and forcing results. It’s not about an inherent wickedness in a person but rather the <strong>misalignment between imagination and higher, positive creative truths</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Shift your inner state. Embrace the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, trust your imagination, and you’ll naturally leave wickedness behind and create the life you truly desire.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
