<h1>Touching Jesus and the Flow of Blood</h1>
<p><br /></p><hr /><h3>The Flow Stops: Neville Goddard on the Power of Belief and Healing</h3><p>Neville Goddard, a master of metaphysical interpretation, offers a profound perspective on the biblical story of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5, Luke 8, Matthew 9). He presents this event not as a mere historical tale, but as a powerful allegory for the influence of our inner world on shaping our outer reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Unceasing Drain: A Symbol of Persistent Problems</strong></h3><p>For Neville, the woman’s continuous flow of blood is not just a physical ailment. It represents:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chronic, unwanted conditions</strong> that drain our vitality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could be <strong>health issues, financial struggles, relationship problems</strong>, or any aspect of life that feels persistently draining and resistant to change.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These issues leave us feeling <strong>depleted</strong> and <strong>hopeless</strong>, mirroring the woman’s ongoing suffering.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Decisive Touch: A Shift in Consciousness</strong></h3><p>The woman’s act of reaching out to touch the hem of Jesus’ garment is not just a physical interaction — it is a <strong>shift in consciousness</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>"hem of the garment"</strong> represents the edge of Jesus’ <strong>realized state of wholeness</strong> — a symbol of <strong>healing</strong> and <strong>well-being</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her touch signifies a <strong>mental and emotional connection</strong> to this desired state, marking a pivotal change in her mindset.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>Belief: The Engine of Transformation</strong></h3><p>At the core of Neville's interpretation is the <strong>woman's unwavering belief</strong> that the single act of touching Jesus' garment would bring healing.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Belief</strong> is the <strong>active force</strong> that triggers change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn't the physical touch itself, but the <strong>inner knowing</strong> and <strong>certainty</strong> that preceded and accompanied the action that held the transformative power.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>The Outflow of Power: Manifestation in the External</strong></h3><p>When Jesus felt power leave him, it symbolized the <strong>tangible manifestation</strong> of the woman’s belief in her external reality.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Her <strong>internal shift</strong> in consciousness resulted in a corresponding <strong>physical change</strong> in her condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unseen <strong>power of conviction</strong> transformed into a visible <strong>result</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>Faith Made Whole: The Source of All Healing</strong></h3><p>Jesus' statement, "Your faith has made you whole," underscores a crucial principle:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The healing didn’t come from an external source but from the <strong>woman’s own faith</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Her unwavering acceptance</strong> and <strong>conviction</strong> in the reality of her desired state initiated the transformation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This highlights the <strong>innate power</strong> within each individual to shape their own experiences.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Key Takeaways from Neville's Interpretation:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consciousness Creates:</strong> Your dominant beliefs and feelings actively shape your external world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent Problems Reflect Inner States:</strong> Unwanted conditions are often sustained by persistent negative thought patterns and assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decisive Belief Triggers Change:</strong> A firm, unwavering conviction in your desired outcome is essential for transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Power Within:</strong> The ability to heal and create your reality lies within your own consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></h3><p>Neville uses this compelling biblical narrative to teach us that by decisively shifting our inner beliefs and fully assuming the feeling of our wish fulfilled, we can stop the <strong>"flow"</strong> of any unwanted circumstance and step into a state of <strong>wholeness</strong> and <strong>well-being</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>power to change</strong> our lives resides within <strong>us</strong>.</p><hr /><p>
