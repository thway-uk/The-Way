<h1>Reading the Bible As If You’re God Speaking</h1>
<p>The Bible can be hard to make sense of if you read it as stories about other people and a God outside of you. But everything starts to shift when you read it as if <em>you</em> are the one speaking—as if every “I” in the Bible is <em>your</em> voice.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, when it says <em>“I am the Lord thy God,”</em> you’re not meant to hear it as a voice from the sky. You read it as <em>your own inner being</em> speaking—your awareness, your sense of “I AM”. It’s not someone else in charge of your life. It’s you. You’re the one declaring, creating, and moving through the story.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Bible becomes less about following orders and more about recognising your own creative power. You’re not watching from the outside anymore. You’re speaking the words yourself—<em>“Let there be light,”</em> <em>“I will never leave you,”</em> <em>“I am with you always.”</em></p>
<p>Later, in the New Testament, the same approach applies. You read as if <em>you</em> are Jesus speaking—not to others, but to your own mind, your own thoughts, your own states of consciousness.</p>
<p>When Jesus says things like, <em>“I am the way, the truth, and the life,”</em> you’re not reading it as a statement about someone else. You’re affirming it to yourself. Jesus becomes the voice of your awakened self—your higher awareness, guiding your inner world.</p>
<p>So when he says, <em>“Your faith has made you whole,”</em> or <em>“Go, and sin no more,”</em> you hear it as your own mind instructing itself, helping you shift into a better state.</p>
<p>Reading the Bible this way makes it personal. You’re not looking up to someone greater—you’re looking inward, speaking with power, claiming your identity, and shaping your reality.</p>
<p>It turns the Bible from a confusing book of distant events into something direct and useful. It becomes a tool for understanding your own consciousness—and how to change it.</p>
