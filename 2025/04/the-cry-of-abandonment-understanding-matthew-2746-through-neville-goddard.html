<h1>The Cry of Abandonment: Understanding Matthew 27:46 Through Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>Matthew 27:46 contains one of the most powerful and emotional moments in the Passion narrative. In this verse, Jesus cries out in despair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?’”</em> (Matthew 27:46, NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment, often interpreted in traditional Christian theology as a genuine cry of abandonment from Jesus towards God, can be deeply unsettling. However, when we approach this passage through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings, it takes on a far more profound and symbolic meaning.</p>
<h3><strong>Neville’s Symbolic Interpretation of Matthew 27:46</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus as Imagination and Consciousness</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to Neville Goddard, Jesus represents the human imagination—the creative consciousness within us all. Jesus is not just a historical figure; in Neville’s view, he symbolises the power of imagination and the ability we all have to shape our reality through thought, belief, and feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Jesus cries out in despair, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” it symbolises a moment of internal conflict, a feeling of disconnection from the divine source. It reflects the experience of the individual when their creative imagination feels cut off from their higher self or divine power during moments of struggle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Moment of Doubt and Despair</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cry of abandonment is a universal experience for anyone striving to manifest their desires or create a new reality. It represents those moments of doubt, frustration, and inner turmoil when it feels as though our efforts are in vain. When we’re working with the law of assumption and the creative power of imagination, we may sometimes question whether our desires will ever come to fruition, especially when the external world appears unresponsive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neville often spoke of the importance of persistence and faith, even in the face of doubt. This moment of abandonment represents the emotional and mental struggle of believing in our creative power when everything around us seems to contradict it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Why Have You Forsaken Me?” – The Conflict Between Faith and Doubt</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The question “Why have You forsaken Me?” symbolises the inner conflict between faith and doubt. In Neville’s interpretation, this cry happens when a person’s belief in their ability to manifest is challenged by doubt. The feeling of abandonment arises when they begin to question the creative power within them and feel disconnected from the divine source or the manifestation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This cry is not just about despair; it’s about the intense psychological battle between old, limiting beliefs and the emerging power of imagination. It’s a key moment in the journey to manifestation, where the individual is being tested, and their faith in their own creative power is being pushed to its limits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Dark Night of the Soul</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neville often referred to the “dark night of the soul”—a period of spiritual darkness and testing that many seekers experience. This moment in Matthew 27:46 can be interpreted as the cry during the dark night of the soul, when one feels spiritually disconnected and doubts whether their desires will ever manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Neville would stress that this feeling of forsakenness is an illusion. It’s a temporary phase in the transformative process. Just as Jesus’ cry on the cross is a necessary part of his journey to resurrection, this feeling of abandonment is part of the mental and emotional purification that occurs before a new reality emerges. It’s not the end, but a moment before the breakthrough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Ninth Hour – The Climax of the Internal Struggle</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In biblical symbolism, the ninth hour is significant because it represents the point of completion or finality. Neville saw this hour as the critical moment when the individual’s inner struggle reaches its peak. It’s the time of greatest tension, just before the resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ninth hour symbolises the final confrontation with doubt and the release of the old beliefs that have been holding the individual back. It’s at this point that the person must have unwavering faith in their imagination and the power of their assumptions. Just as the crucifixion marks the end of one phase, the ninth hour signifies the imminent transformation and the beginning of a new, empowered phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Cry is Not the End</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, Matthew 27:46 is not a cry of literal abandonment, but a symbolic moment that highlights the inner conflict between faith and doubt. Jesus’ cry represents the feeling of being forsaken when the power of imagination seems ineffective, and the person begins to question their ability to manifest their desires.</p>
<p>However, this cry is a necessary part of the process. It reflects the internal battle between old, limiting beliefs and the new, creative power emerging within. The feeling of abandonment is not permanent; it’s a transitional phase. Neville teaches that after the crucifixion (the “death” of old beliefs) comes the resurrection—a new state of consciousness that allows the person to align with their true creative power.</p>
<p>So, when you face those moments of doubt, when you feel like you’re being “forsaken” by the universe or your own creative abilities, remember that it’s simply part of the transformation. The breakthrough is coming, and like Jesus, you too will rise from this moment of despair into a new, more empowered reality.</p>
