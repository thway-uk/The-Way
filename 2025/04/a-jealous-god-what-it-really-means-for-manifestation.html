<h1>"A Jealous God": What It Really Means for Manifestation</h1>
<p>The Old Testament often describes God as <em>“a jealous God.”</em> To the modern ear, this can sound unsettling. Why would God—a being of infinite love—be jealous?</p>
<p>But as Neville Goddard so often reminded us, <strong>the Bible is a psychological drama</strong>. The characters, the stories, the commandments—they aren’t about history or morality in the way we’ve been taught. They’re about <strong>you</strong>. They’re about <strong>your consciousness</strong>, your imagination, your creative power.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when the Bible says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God.”</em><br />
— <em>Exodus 20:5</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><strong>God as Your “I AM”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville taught that <strong>God is your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. Not a distant being in the sky, but your very awareness of being—your <em>I AM</em>. That which says, “I am happy,” “I am poor,” “I am healed,” or “I am unloved”—and then manifests it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“God became man, that man may become God.”</em><br />
— Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this view, when the Bible says God is jealous, it’s not speaking of divine insecurity. It’s describing the <strong>exclusive nature of your creative power</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Your Imagination Will Not Share Power</strong></h3>
<p>Your <em>I AM</em> cannot create if you keep placing power outside of it. If you say, <em>“I’ll be happy when they change,”</em> or <em>“I need this situation to fix itself,”</em> you're bowing before another god. You're declaring that <strong>something other than your own consciousness has power</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the jealousy.</p>
<p>It’s not emotion—it’s <strong>spiritual integrity</strong>. The law of manifestation won’t function in a divided mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am the Lord, and there is no other; besides me there is no God.”</em><br />
— <em>Isaiah 45:5</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Fidelity to the Invisible</strong></h3>
<p>Just as a lover expects fidelity, <strong>your imagination demands loyalty</strong>. You cannot affirm your desire in imagination, then run back to fear, doubt, and outer appearances. You are either faithful to the unseen or enslaved to the seen. The “jealousy” of God is a call to <strong>inner faithfulness</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let the weak say, I am strong.”</em> — <em>Joel 3:10</em><br />
<em>Not because they are strong—but because in saying it, they become it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><strong>What Does This Mean for You?</strong></h3>
<p>When you feel divided—believing in the power of imagination one day, and then bowing to fear the next—it’s not punishment you feel. It’s the <em>friction</em> of going against your own divine nature. Your God-self is “jealous” because it knows there is no other creative power but your <strong>own assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>The moment you return to the truth—<em>“I and my Father are one”</em>—peace returns. Assumption takes root. And your world begins to reflect it.</p>
