<h1>Summary of Jesus Weeping Interpretated by Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>"Neville Goddard frequently addressed biblical stories and verses from a metaphysical perspective, emphasizing that scripture is not historical but rather a psychological drama playing out within each individual. When it comes to the verse "Jesus wept" (John 11:35), Neville's interpretation aligns with this overall approach.</p><p>Here's a summary of what Neville Goddard conveyed about Jesus weeping, drawing from his online works:</p><p> * Not Literal Sadness, but Profound Experiencing: Neville often suggests that Jesus' weeping is not simply an expression of sorrow in the conventional sense. Instead, he sees it as a profound emotional response that accompanies a deep experiencing of truth.</p><p> * The Nature of True Knowing: He contrasts intellectual understanding with true, experiential knowing. Peter, for example, intellectually heard the prophecies but wept bitterly only when the events unfolded within him. Similarly, Jesus' weeping signifies a moment of deep realization and the full impact of a spiritual truth being experienced.</p><p> * The "Experiencing Nature": Neville emphasizes the importance of having an "experiencing nature" to truly grasp spiritual realities. He links intense emotions, like weeping, to this capacity to deeply feel and embody truth. He states that it is from this "experiencing nature" that faith, hope, and love are refined through life's challenges.</p><p> * Symbolic of Inner Transformation: In line with his overall interpretation of biblical figures as aspects of the individual's consciousness, Jesus' weeping can be seen as a symbolic representation of a deep shift or transformation occurring within the individual as they awaken to spiritual truths.</p><p> * A Universal Human Experience: While attributed to Jesus in the Bible, Neville implies that this kind of profound emotional response to experienced truth is a universal human potential. It's a hallmark of a genuine spiritual awakening and realization.</p><p> * Connection to Other Biblical Weeping: He also mentions Peter weeping bitterly after denying Jesus. This, too, is framed not just as remorse, but as a consequence of the truth being experienced and the realization of his own actions in light of that truth.</p><p>In essence, for Neville Goddard, when the Bible says "Jesus wept," it's not primarily about historical sadness. It's a powerful symbol of the deep emotional resonance that accompanies the experiential realization of profound spiritual truths within the individual human consciousness. It signifies a shift from intellectual understanding to a deep, embodied knowing". - Gemini AI</p><div><br /></div>
