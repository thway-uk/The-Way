<h1>The Story of Legion: A Psychological Parable of the Victim Mindset</h1>
<p>In the story of Legion (Mark 5:1–20, Luke 8:26–39), Jesus encounters a man possessed by many demons. However, according to Neville Goddard, this is not a literal event—it’s a <strong>psychological parable</strong> that unfolds within each of us. Neville taught that the Bible expresses spiritual truths through symbolic language, and this story powerfully illustrates a common internal struggle today: the <strong>victim mindset</strong>.</p><hr /><h2>Legion: More Than Just Demons</h2><p>When the man says,</p><blockquote>
<p>“My name is Legion, for we are many,”</p>
</blockquote><p>he isn’t simply referring to external demons. Neville interprets this as representing a person fragmented by <strong>countless negative beliefs and limiting assumptions</strong>—the state we fall into when we believe life happens <em>to</em> us rather than <em>through</em> us.</p><p>This idea resonates deeply with the <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Hebrew name for God, <strong>Elohim</strong></a>. Unlike most divine names in the Bible, Elohim is plural in form, signifying a <strong>plurality of creative forces or conscious powers</strong> unified in harmony. In the beginning, Elohim represented a pure, undivided consciousness—a creative unity of many aspects working as one.</p><p>The “Legion” state, by contrast, symbolises the fragmentation and corruption of this divine unity within us. Instead of harmony, many conflicting and disempowering voices compete for control. These internal "demons" represent the polluted states of mind that distort our true nature and cloud our awareness of creative power.</p><hr /><h2>The Legion State: The Voice of Victimhood</h2><p>Living as “Legion” means identifying with the internal chorus of excuses and complaints:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“I can’t because of what they did.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Life’s unfair, and there’s nothing I can do.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the language of the victim mindset, where identity is entangled with past trauma, perceived injustice, or failure. Neville reminds us these are not fixed realities but <strong>mental states of consciousness</strong> we have mistakenly accepted as true.</p><hr /><h2>Jesus as the Awakened Imagination</h2><p>In this parable, Jesus symbolises the <strong>awakened imagination</strong>—the conscious creative power within each of us. Healing occurs the moment the man (you) stops identifying with the many and reclaims the <strong>“One” within—the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a></strong>.</p><p>This pivotal shift is the movement from powerlessness to recognising yourself as the <strong>operant power</strong>, the creator of your experience.</p><hr /><h2>The Pigs: The Reactive Subconscious</h2><p>The pigs into which the demons are cast symbolise the lower, reactive mind—the base impulses and limiting thoughts that cannot survive when consciousness changes.</p><p>When you cease feeding the victim story and begin to consciously assume your desired state, these limiting beliefs retreat into the subconscious and lose their influence.</p><hr /><h2>Transformation Through Assumption</h2><p>Neville’s teaching is clear: true deliverance does not come from blaming external circumstances or waiting for salvation. It emerges from an <strong>inner change of assumption</strong>.</p><p>When you shift from,</p><blockquote>
<p>“I am broken because of them,”</p>
</blockquote><p>to boldly affirming,</p><blockquote>
<p>“I AM whole,”</p>
</blockquote><p>you step out of the “Legion” state. You become clothed in your right mind, restored to the divine unity symbolised by <strong>Elohim</strong>—a whole, creative consciousness free from fragmentation.</p><hr /><h3>Summary</h3><p>The story of Legion is a powerful metaphor for the internal battle between fragmented, victim consciousness and the restored unity of creative awareness. Elohim, the plural name of God, points to the original unity of multiple creative forces in harmony, a state we are invited to reclaim.</p><p>By recognising Jesus as the awakened imagination and choosing to shed the many limiting voices, you return to the one true creative source within—your I AM—and experience freedom, wholeness, and true power.</p>
