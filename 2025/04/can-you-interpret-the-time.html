<h1>Can You Interpret the Time?</h1>
<p><em>Understanding Jesus' Challenge Through Neville Goddard’s Teachings</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You see a cloud coming up in the west, and straight away you say, ‘There will be rain’; and so it is.<br />
And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be heat’; and so it is.<br />
O you false ones! the face of the earth and the heaven you are able to make out: but how is it that you are not able to make out this time?”</em><br />
— Luke 12:54–56 (BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know when rain is coming.<br />
We know when the wind means heat.<br />
We read signs all day long—news headlines, market shifts, even people’s moods.<br />
But Jesus points to something far more important:</p>
<p><strong>Can you make out <em>this</em> time?</strong><br />
Not the time on the clock, but the <strong>inner time</strong>.<br />
The <strong>state of being</strong> you’re dwelling in right now.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this is crucial. He’d say that the real “weather” is your state of consciousness.</p>
<p>You are always planting seeds in imagination—are you aware of which ones are about to bloom?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you notice when a desire is <em>alive</em> in you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you feel when it’s time to shift inwardly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you recognise the signs that your inner world is ready to manifest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The “false ones” Jesus refers to? Not bad people.<br />
They are the parts of us that <strong>only observe the outer</strong> and miss the <strong>truth within</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville would remind us:<br />
To <em>make out the time</em> is to become conscious of your <strong>inner movement</strong>, your <strong>inner season</strong>, and to live from the state you truly desire.</p>
<p><strong>That’s the real forecast.</strong></p>
