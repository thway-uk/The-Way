<h1>Paul and Acts: The Ascension of Christ Within</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s symbolic interpretation of Scripture, Paul’s journey is not simply the historical record of an apostle—it is a <strong>manifestation of the transformation of consciousness</strong>. Paul represents the <strong>awakening of inner vision</strong> and the power of assumption. His story is a guide to spiritual liberation, showing us how to move from <strong>outer law to inner grace</strong>.</p><p>But to truly understand Paul’s emergence, we must first examine the departure of <strong>Jesus</strong>, for Paul’s story begins where Jesus’ outward presence ends.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jesus’ Departure: The Withdrawal of the Outer Teacher</strong></h3><p>In <strong>Acts 1</strong>, after Jesus’ resurrection, He appears to the disciples and speaks of the Kingdom of God, and then, in a dramatic moment, He ascends into the heavens:</p><p><strong>“He was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.”</strong><br />
— <em>Acts 1:9</em></p><p>In Neville’s framework, this ascension is not an abandonment but a <strong>symbolic act</strong>. Jesus represents <strong>the divine imagination</strong>, the very source of creation. His departure is the <strong>inner realisation</strong> that the divine power is no longer an external force but exists within us.</p><p>As Neville taught:</p><blockquote>
<p>"The drama of Jesus is a psychological one which takes place in the consciousness of every man."</p>
</blockquote><p>The “cloud” that receives Him represents the <strong>mystical inner consciousness</strong>—the place where the power of God rests. When Jesus ascends, it marks a shift from relying on an external saviour to <strong>realising that you, as the imagination, are the creator</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Enter Paul: The Internalisation of Christ</strong></h3><p>Immediately following Jesus’ departure, the narrative turns to the apostles and, in particular, to <strong>Paul</strong>. Unlike the other apostles, <strong>Paul never physically encountered Jesus</strong>. Instead, his encounter was purely spiritual:</p><p><strong>“And as he journeyed, suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven.”</strong><br />
— <em>Acts 9:3</em></p><p>This light is not an external phenomenon but an inner awakening. It represents <strong>the moment of illumination</strong> when Paul (symbolising the individual soul) realises that the Christ—the divine power—exists <em>within</em>. In that moment, Saul’s sight is blinded, symbolising the loss of reliance on the outer senses. For three days, he cannot see, representing the <strong>death of the old self</strong>—the ego that sees only physical reality. But when Paul regains his sight, he is no longer the same man. He is transformed, a <strong>new identity</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Paul’s Teachings: The Shift from the Flesh to the Spirit</strong></h3><p>As Paul’s teachings unfold, he stresses the importance of moving beyond the physical and external, urging that we should no longer consider Jesus in the flesh. This is beautifully expressed in <strong>2 Corinthians 5:16</strong>:</p><p><strong>“Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.”</strong></p><p>This passage reflects the shift from an external, historical understanding of Christ to a <strong>realisation of Christ as a spiritual presence within</strong>. In Neville’s teachings, this aligns with the understanding that Jesus represents the <strong>divine imagination</strong>, and no longer should we view the Christ consciousness through the lens of the physical realm. We are now called to perceive Christ, not as a person in the past, but as a <strong>living principle within each of us</strong>, waiting to be awakened.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Transformation of Saul to Paul: The Shift from Outer Law to Inner Grace</strong></h3><p>Saul, the persecutor of believers, represents the <strong>egoic mind</strong>, bound by reason, tradition, and external law. But when he becomes <strong>Paul</strong>, he embodies the <strong>higher self</strong>—the part of you that knows truth beyond the physical world.</p><p>This shift is pivotal. As Neville would say, <strong>“You are not becoming; you are remembering who you already are.”</strong> Saul’s transformation into Paul symbolises the <strong>awakening of your divine imagination</strong>, the realisation that Christ—the power of creation—is <strong>within you</strong>. You no longer follow an external saviour; you <strong>become</strong> the saviour, as Christ’s consciousness takes root in you.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Paul: The Embodiment of Living from Within</strong></h3><p>As Paul moves through his journeys in Acts, he encounters challenges, opposition, imprisonment, and even shipwreck. But these external experiences reflect his <strong>inner state of being</strong>—his absolute conviction that the <strong>kingdom of God</strong> is within. Paul faces trials, but he does not surrender. Instead, he <strong>acts as though the end is already realised</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The shipwreck in <em>Acts 27</em> and his survival after a snakebite in <em>Acts 28</em> show that <strong>your faith</strong> (living from the wish fulfilled) makes the impossible possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Acts 16</em>, when Paul and Silas are imprisoned, they sing hymns of praise, and the jail doors are miraculously opened. This is a powerful symbol of how <strong>joyful faith breaks open limitation</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Paul is constantly manifesting from his higher state of being. He is no longer the <strong>man who sees with the outer eye</strong>; he is the man who <strong>lives from the imagination</strong>, the Christ within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Christ Within: Paul as the Symbol of Inner Realisation</strong></h3><p>Paul, after his conversion, speaks of <strong>Christ revealed in him</strong>, not to him:</p><p><strong>“It pleased God… to reveal His Son in me.”</strong><br />
— <em>Galatians 1:15–16</em></p><p>This is the <strong>inner realisation</strong> Neville emphasised: Christ is <strong>not a person to follow</strong> but a <strong>principle to embody</strong>. When you recognise the divine power within, you step into your own Christ-like role. You are the creator, the operant power of your own world. Paul’s transformation is the <strong>realisation that God lives within you</strong> and that you have the power to manifest your desires by assuming the end and living from that state.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: From Jesus to Paul—A Spiritual Awakening</strong></h3><p>Jesus’ ascension is not the end of the story. It is the <strong>beginning of an internal revolution</strong>. Paul’s rise represents the <strong>awakening of the divine imagination</strong> within each of us. The outer teacher (Jesus) gives way to the <strong>inner Christ</strong>—the realisation that God is within, and through this recognition, you can manifest your desires, heal your world, and transform your life.</p><p>As Paul writes:</p><p><strong>“Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.”</strong><br />
— <em>Ephesians 5:14</em></p><p>This is the awakening we must all have. Jesus’ departure is your call to go within, to realise that <strong>you are the Christ in your life</strong>, and that <strong>through imagination and faith, you create your own reality</strong>.</p><p><strong>“I have been crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me…”</strong><br />
— <em>Galatians 2:20</em></p><p>Paul’s message is the <strong>message of Neville Goddard</strong>: that <strong>you are the operant power</strong>, and Christ is in you. The external Jesus is no longer needed because <strong>you are the living Christ</strong>.</p><p><br /></p>
