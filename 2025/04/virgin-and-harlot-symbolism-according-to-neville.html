<h1>Virgin and Harlot Symbolism According to Neville</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, <strong>manifestation depends entirely on the assumption of the “I AM” </strong><i>(Exodus 3:14)</i>—the self-identification or feeling of the wish fulfilled impressed upon the subconscious mind. The subconscious is the fertile ground that manifests whatever it faithfully accepts.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Harlot: The Ungoverned, Indiscriminate Subconscious</strong></h3><p>The harlot symbolizes the subconscious mind that <strong>gives itself indiscriminately to many conflicting assumptions</strong>. Like a prostitute who offers herself without loyalty, the subconscious in this state is unfaithful and unstable. It accepts any thought, belief, or impression—whether empowering or limiting—resulting in a chaotic, scattered reality.</p><p>This subconscious is <em>ungoverned</em> by a clear “I AM” and thus produces unstable and unwanted manifestations because it has no single guiding assumption.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Scarlet Cord: The Faithful Mental Image</strong></h3><p>The scarlet cord represents the <em>mental image</em> or <em>feeling</em>—the vivid, faithful assumption—that one consciously impresses on the subconscious. It is the <strong>signal or mark</strong> that anchors the subconscious mind to a specific “I AM” and declares loyalty to that assumption.</p><p>By “hanging the scarlet cord,” you firmly impress your chosen assumption with feeling, guiding your subconscious toward manifesting your desired reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Virgin: The Faithful, Pure Subconscious</strong></h3><p>The virgin symbolizes the subconscious mind that is <strong>pure and devoted to one clear, consistent assumption</strong>. Like a virgin faithful to a single partner, this subconscious remains loyal to one “I AM” and manifests that reality powerfully and without confusion.</p><p>This state of the subconscious is disciplined, receptive, and aligned with the desired outcome.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Transformation: From Harlot to Virgin</strong></h3><p>The shift from the harlot to the virgin is the process of <strong>redeeming the subconscious mind by impressing a single, faithful assumption</strong>. This is done through conscious imagination and feeling, living in the end as if the assumption is already true.</p><p>As you persist in this assumption, the subconscious mind becomes loyal—transforming from the indiscriminate harlot to the devoted virgin—and manifests your desire with certainty.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul>
