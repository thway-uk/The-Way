<h1>“My Hour Has Not Yet Come” – A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of John, Jesus says to his mother, <em>“My hour has not yet come”</em> (John 2:4). On the surface, this may appear to be a simple reference to timing or circumstance. But according to <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, this statement holds a far deeper, metaphysical meaning—one that reveals something essential about the nature of consciousness and the process of manifestation.</p>
<p>Neville taught that <strong>Scripture is psychological rather than historical</strong>, and the characters within the Bible represent <strong>states of consciousness</strong>. For him, Jesus symbolises the <strong>human imagination</strong>, especially when it becomes aware of its divine, creative power. In this light, Jesus’s words are not those of a man stalling an event, but of <strong>consciousness recognising that a certain inner state has not yet matured</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Symbolism of “Hour”</h3>
<p>According to Neville, <strong>time in Scripture is symbolic</strong>. The term <em>“hour”</em> does not refer to clock time, but to the <strong>inner moment of readiness</strong>—the psychological point when a person has fully accepted a new state of being. That is, when one has imagined and felt a desire so vividly and persistently that it becomes an unquestioned truth within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a time interval between the acceptance of the desire (imagined fulfilment) and its expression in the world of form.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, when Jesus says, <em>“My hour has not yet come,”</em> he is expressing that the <strong>inner alignment necessary for manifestation</strong> has not yet occurred. The desire may be present, but the state of consciousness required to bring it into form has not been fully occupied or embodied.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Turning of Water into Wine</h3>
<p>Interestingly, Jesus says these words just before performing his first recorded miracle—<strong>turning water into wine at the wedding in Cana</strong> (John 2:1–11). This miracle, according to Neville, is symbolic of the <strong>transformation of the ordinary (water) into the extraordinary (wine)</strong>—a metaphor for how <strong>imagination transforms reality</strong>.</p>
<p>The miracle happens <strong>after</strong> the inner realisation—the moment the “hour” <em>does</em> arrive. Once Jesus (or the Imagination) fully inhabits the state of the wish fulfilled, the outer world must conform to that new inner truth. In Neville’s language, <strong>once the inner act is complete</strong>, the outer must follow.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Gestation of Desire</h3>
<p>One of Neville’s consistent messages is that <strong>every desire has a gestation period</strong>. Just as a seed needs time in the soil before it can bloom, so too must a desire be nurtured and <em>felt</em> in imagination before it becomes tangible. The “hour” symbolises the moment <strong>inner conviction replaces doubt</strong>, and the <strong>conscious mind and subconscious mind are in agreement</strong>.</p>
<p>Until then, the desire remains in the imaginal womb—growing, shifting, becoming. The external delay isn’t punishment or failure; it’s a natural part of the creative process.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: Inner Readiness Precedes Outer Fulfilment</h3>
<p>To Neville Goddard, <em>“My hour has not yet come”</em> is a profound statement about <strong>inner preparation</strong> and the <strong>timing of manifestation</strong>. The outer world only changes when the <strong>inner self has accepted the change as real</strong>. Your “hour” is whenever you fully embody the state of your desire—not in theory, but in feeling, belief, and certainty.</p>
<p>So if your dream has not yet materialised, it’s not that your “hour” will never come. It simply hasn’t <strong>arrived in consciousness</strong>. Persist in assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and when your inner world aligns with your desire, the outer must reflect it. That is the law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and live in that assumption, and that assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
