<h1>Psalm 139:14 - Fearfully and Wonderfully Made</h1>
<p>In <strong>Psalm 139:14</strong>, it says:</p><p>
<em>“I will give you praise; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are your works; and that my soul knows right well.”</em> </p><p>This verse is a powerful reminder of the <strong>creative power</strong> within each of us—especially through <strong>imagination</strong>. Neville Goddard would interpret this as a symbol of the <strong>dual nature</strong> of the imagination. It can create <strong>fear</strong> or <strong>wonder</strong>, depending on our awareness and how we choose to use it.</p><h3><strong>Fear or Wonder? The Choice is Ours</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fearfully</strong>: The imagination can create <strong>fear</strong> when we focus on <strong>negative thoughts</strong> or imagined worst-case scenarios. If we’re not aware of the power we hold, our unconscious thoughts can bring our worst fears into reality. Neville warned that <strong>uncontrolled imagination</strong> can manifest undesirable outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wonderfully</strong>: On the other hand, the imagination is a <strong>wonderful</strong> force when we use it with <strong>intention</strong>. By focusing on positive thoughts, dreams, and desires, we tap into the creative potential of the imagination to bring <strong>miraculous outcomes</strong>. Through conscious use, our imagination helps us manifest the life we truly desire.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Awareness is Key</strong></h3><p>The key to transforming our lives is <strong>awareness</strong>. When we understand that we are <strong>fearfully and wonderfully made</strong>, we realise that the power of creation lies in our hands. By becoming aware of how we use our imagination, we can choose to create <strong>wonder</strong> instead of fear.</p><h3><strong>A New Perspective on Creation</strong></h3><p>Psalm 139:14 reminds us that <strong>we are creators</strong>—able to shape our reality with the power of our imagination. When we consciously direct our thoughts and imaginations, we move beyond fear and embrace the potential for <strong>wonder</strong> and <strong>miracles</strong> in our lives.</p><p><br /></p>
