<h1>Elisha and Elijah: 2 Kings 2</h1>
<p>This chapter shows the shift from one state of consciousness (Elijah) to a higher state (Elisha). Elijah represents the awareness of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God as your own wonderful human</a> imagination. Elisha symbolises the awakened state — the one who knows imagination is the only reality and begins to consciously direct it. These preliminary attempts at assumption proceed the ultimate example given in the crucifixion of Jesus</p><p><strong>Elijah and Elisha: Passing the State</strong></p><p>Elijah means "My God is Jehovah" — the realisation that your imagination is God. Elisha means "God is salvation" — the understanding that salvation (change) comes only through your imagination. The passing of the mantle means moving from knowing imagination as power to actually using it.</p><p><strong>Crossing the Jordan: Leaving the Old Self</strong></p><p>The Jordan always symbolises passing from an old state into a new one. Crossing it is moving out of an old concept of self into a higher one.</p><p><strong>The Mantle: Your Imaginative Power</strong></p><p>Elijah’s mantle stands for your imaginative power. When Elisha asks for a double portion, it a mental request for abundance an increase. Receiving the mantle means you now take on the responsibility to use imagination consciously. </p><p><strong>Elijah’s Ascension: Rising in Consciousness</strong></p><p>Elijah going up in a whirlwind means moving beyond the senses and rising into a higher state. Neville would say this is lifting your awareness to the feeling of the wish fulfilled — the true ascension.</p><p><strong>The Mocking Children: Doubts and Old Thoughts</strong></p><p>The children mocking Elisha represent your doubts and old limiting thoughts that resist your new assumption. When you move into a new state, these old ideas try to pull you back.</p><p><strong>The Bears: Destroying Limiting Beliefs</strong></p><p>The she-bears killing the children is the imagination (the creative, receptive side of consciousness) destroying those old, mocking doubts. It shows that once you fix your assumption, all opposing thoughts die away.</p><p><strong>Healing the Waters with Salt: Purifying the Subconscious</strong></p><p>Elisha healing the waters with salt symbolises purifying the subconscious. Salt represents preservation — fixing your new state firmly. Healing the waters means clearing old negative beliefs so your new state can flow freely.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>2 Kings 2 is all about moving from one state of consciousness to another. Elijah shows us the awareness of God as imagination. Elisha shows us living from that power. Crossing the Jordan, receiving the mantle, rising in consciousness, and destroying doubts all show the inner process of shifting assumptions and stepping into a new identity. In Neville’s terms, it’s the story of moving from knowing "I AM" to fully living as "I AM that I AM."</p>
