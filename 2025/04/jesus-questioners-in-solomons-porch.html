<h1>Jesus: Questioners in Solomon’s Porch</h1>
<p>At first glance, the passage of John 10:22–30 seems a simple account: a gathering of questioners, a hesitant crowd demanding clarity from <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>. Yet, through the vision of Neville Goddard, these words unveil a inward drama — a quiet but momentous unfolding within the mind of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a>.</p><p>It is a scene of dedication, of recognition, and of the eternal unity between <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man’s imagination</a> and <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">awareness of being</a>.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Feast of Dedication: A Temple Within</strong></h3><p></p><blockquote>“At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.” (John 10:22–23)</blockquote><p></p><p>The Feast of Dedication — Hanukkah — marks, symbolically, the inner sanctifying of the mind.<br />
It is the moment when man’s awareness is cleansed of doubt and consecrated to a new vision:<br />
the realisation that his own I AM is the living God.</p><p>Jesus walking within <a href="/2025/05/building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">Solomon’s Porch</a> is not an external scene, but the movement of awakened imagination within the sacred corridors of one's own consciousness.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Questioning Mind: "If You Are the Christ, Tell Us Plainly"</strong></h3><p></p><blockquote>“The Jews gathered around him and said to him, ‘How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’” (John 10:24)</blockquote><p></p><p>Here, the "Jews" represent the outer mind, the rational intellect which demands evidence from the senses.<br />
It is the voice within that craves external proof, never trusting the silent, living certainty that springs from within.</p><p>But the spiritual life begins when one ceases to demand signs, and instead accepts — without outward proof — that I AM is the sole reality.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The True Sheep: Those Who Hear Within</strong></h3><p></p><blockquote>“Jesus answered them, ‘I told you, and you do not believe... My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.’” (John 10:25–27)</blockquote><p></p><p>Despite the constant whispering of imagination, the doubting mind does not believe, for it listens only to what the outer world proclaims.</p><p>The "<a href="/search/label/Shepherd%20and%20Lamb%20Series">sheep</a>" are the <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">obedient faculties of consciousness — those thoughts, assumptions, </a>and quiet imaginings that respond to the voice within and follow it, even in the absence of visible confirmation.</p><p>To be a sheep is to hear inwardly, and to move faithfully according to the unseen word spoken by one’s own I AM.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Eternal Life: The Gift of Inner Certainty</strong></h3><p></p><blockquote>“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.” (John 10:28)</blockquote><p></p><p>When imagination is recognised as the source of all creation, one steps into the knowledge of eternal life:<br />
a life not determined by the transitory world of appearances, but sustained by the imperishable creative power within.</p><p>This truth, once accepted, is secure.<br />
It cannot be undone by any force external to oneself, unless one surrenders it by reverting to disbelief.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Great Unity: "I and the Father Are One"</strong></h3><p></p><blockquote>“I and the Father are one.” (John 10:30)</blockquote><p></p><p>Here, Neville Goddard’s message finds its most perfect echo:<br />
Man’s imagination and God are not two, but one.</p><p>The awareness of being — the I AM within you — is the Father of all that appears.<br />
To awaken to this truth is to realise that you and your source are indivisibly one.</p><p>The division between God and man, imagination and reality, creator and creation — it is only a shadow cast by forgetfulness.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Inner Dedication</strong></h3><p>Thus, John 10:22–30 is not a historical account, but an inward journey.</p><p>It calls each of us to dedicate the temple of our mind; to leave behind the restless questioning of the outer senses, and to abide in the silent knowing that within our own imagination dwells the Christ.</p><p>In that sacred union — in the stillness where "I and the Father are one" —<br />
there lies the eternal life, the true creative power, and the fulfilment of all that you could ever seek.</p>
