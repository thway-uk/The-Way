<h1>Music: The Harp</h1>
<p>In the language of Scripture, symbols speak louder than facts. Among them, the harp stands out — delicate, tuned, and profoundly alive. It doesn’t thunder like a trumpet or strike like a sword. Instead, it plays — gently, inwardly, calling forth feeling.</p>
<p>The harp is imagination.<br />
And its strings are tied to the heart.</p>
<p>When David takes up the harp to soothe Saul, it’s not merely sound — it’s spirit. Saul, troubled and restless, represents the old self: reactive, fearful, bound by the senses. David, the symbol of divine awareness and awakened imagination, does not fight him. He plays. He brings harmony to the dissonance through inward poise.</p>
<p>This is what imagination does when rooted in the heart:<br />
It brings order to chaos.<br />
Peace to noise.<br />
Vision to despair.</p>
<p>And yet in <strong>Psalm 137</strong>, the people hang their harps upon the willows. In exile, they say: <em>"How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?"</em><br />
Their imagination — the bridge between what is and what could be — is silenced. The harp, once played from the heart, now hangs limp in grief.<br />
It is a portrait of what happens when we lose faith in our inner world.<br />
When the heart hurts, the harp goes quiet.</p>
<p>But even in exile, the harp is still there. Waiting.<br />
Because imagination can’t be destroyed — only forgotten.</p>
<p>To pick up the harp again is to let the heart hope again.<br />
It is to believe that what you feel within can shape what you see without.</p>
<p>And the strings?<br />
They are your thoughts, your moods, your faith.<br />
They are tuned not by effort, but by the direction of the heart.</p>
