<h1>Praise and Manifestation: A Neville Goddard Approach</h1>
<p>Praise is a powerful force in the Bible, not only as an expression of worship but as a symbol of a deeper truth about the creative power within each of us. Through the lens of Neville Goddard's teachings, praise transcends external ritual and becomes an inner recognition of the divine power of imagination. It’s an act of aligning with the consciousness that shapes our reality. In this article, we will explore how the biblical concept of praise, especially as embodied by figures like Judah, Tamar, and Perez, reflects Neville's understanding of imagination, manifestation, and inner transformation.</p>

<h3><strong>Praise: A Divine Acknowledgement</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, praise is not merely an outward expression of gratitude or adoration for an external God; it’s an inner acknowledgment of the creative power of imagination. Praise is the recognition that the world we experience is the result of the thoughts and beliefs we hold within. By praising, we affirm the truth of our desires and the divine potential within us to manifest them.</p>
<p>The Bible is rich with verses that emphasise the importance of praise, not only for what has been manifested but for the reality that is yet to unfold. Take, for example, <strong>Psalm 150:6</strong>:<br />
<em>“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.”</em><br />
This verse doesn’t just speak to human beings but to all of creation. Praise, in Neville's view, is the recognition that everything is an expression of the same creative force — our imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 34:1</strong> also illustrates the unceasing nature of praise:<br />
<em>“I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.”</em><br />
For Neville, this continual praise reflects the ongoing act of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, a core concept in his teachings. It is a constant mental state of gratitude and recognition, affirming that the desires of the heart are already realised.</p>
<h3><strong>Neville’s Concept of Praise: Aligning with Divine Power</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard's view, praise is not an external act, but a mental posture. It is the recognition that what we desire is already ours, even before it has manifested in the physical world. This form of praise aligns with his law of assumption: by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled and praising the outcome as already true, we allow the imagination to shape our reality.</p>
<p>Neville frequently spoke about the importance of living in the end, imagining and feeling the fulfilment of desires as though they were already realised. Praise, in this sense, becomes an inner confirmation of the truth of that assumption. It is not just a verbal expression but a feeling, a state of consciousness that holds firm in the belief that what we have imagined is already ours.</p>
<h3><strong>Judah, Tamar, and Perez: A Story of Praise and Breakthrough</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most intriguing and symbolic stories in the Bible that connects deeply with Neville’s teachings is that of Judah, Tamar, and Perez. Judah’s name means <em>"praise"</em> or <em>"to be praised,"</em> and his role in the narrative is crucial in understanding how the act of praise unlocks the power to bring forth what is desired. Through this story, we see how praise is tied to the recognition of divine potential and the manifestation of breakthroughs.</p>
<h4><strong>Judah: The Creative Consciousness of Praise</strong></h4>
<p>Judah, the fourth son of Jacob, represents the creative consciousness that acknowledges its own divine power. In Neville's framework, Judah symbolises the part of us that recognises our power to create and shape our reality through the imagination. When Judah praises, he is acknowledging the inner power to bring about manifestation.</p>
<p>The story of Judah and Tamar, found in <strong>Genesis 38</strong>, speaks of Tamar’s determination to secure her family line. After being widowed by two of Judah’s sons, she disguises herself as a prostitute and becomes pregnant by Judah himself, resulting in the birth of Perez. While this may seem a dramatic and unexpected sequence of events, it represents a breakthrough, a manifestation of something new, an expression of divine will breaking through the boundaries of circumstance.</p>
<h4><strong>Tamar and Perez: The Breakthrough of Imagination</strong></h4>
<p>Tamar’s actions serve as a powerful symbol of persistence in the face of adversity. She uses her imagination to create a new reality, one that aligns with the fulfilment of her desires — in this case, ensuring the continuation of her lineage. Tamar embodies Neville’s principle of <em>living in the end</em>, as she acts in faith, trusting that her desires will be realised despite the social constraints around her.</p>
<p>The birth of Perez, whose name means <em>“breach”</em> or <em>“breakthrough,”</em> represents the new beginning that comes from aligning with divine imagination. Perez is the manifestation of a desire fulfilled, the result of faith and determination. In Neville’s language, Perez is the breakthrough that happens when we persist in assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, regardless of external circumstances.</p>
<p>In Neville's teachings, Perez represents the manifestation of what we have imagined when we hold firm to our belief that it is already true. Praise, in this case, becomes the act of recognising that our desired outcome has already been achieved, affirming that the "breach" or "breakthrough" is not just possible but inevitable.</p>
<h4><strong>Judah’s Lineage: A Reflection of Creative Power</strong></h4>
<p>Judah's lineage, which leads to King David and ultimately to Jesus, serves as a symbol of the creative potential within all of us. Just as Judah praised and acknowledged his divine role in the unfolding of God’s plan, we too must praise the power within us that shapes our reality. The kingdom of Judah can be understood as the state of consciousness that is aware of and aligns with divine creative law.</p>
<p>In Neville's perspective, this lineage represents the continuation of divine creative power through consciousness. When we praise, we tap into that creative lineage, recognising that we too can manifest our desires in the same way, by aligning our imagination with the divine order.</p>
<h3><strong>Praise as the Act of Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>For Neville Goddard, praise is not just about recognising God’s greatness but about recognising and affirming the power of imagination to shape reality. To praise is to acknowledge that the desired state of affairs already exists in the realm of imagination. This is the essence of Neville’s teachings: living as though your desire has already been fulfilled and feeling gratitude for the reality that exists in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 21:16</strong> offers an important insight into the relationship between praise and manifestation:<br />
<em>“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read, ‘From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise’?”</em><br />
Children, unburdened by doubt, simply <em>assume</em> what they desire. This simplicity of faith and praise is what Neville encourages — the ability to praise and affirm as though the manifestation is already complete.</p>
<h3><strong>Living in the End: The Role of Praise in Your Manifestation Process</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often spoke of the importance of living in the end — the practice of imagining and feeling that your desires are already realised. Praise, in this context, is the mental and emotional confirmation that the fulfilment of your desire is assured. By praising the outcome, you affirm that it is already part of your reality, which aligns perfectly with Neville’s principle of <em>assumption</em>.</p>
<p>Praise becomes a powerful tool in the manifestation process. When you praise, you are affirming the state of consciousness that is already aligned with the fulfilment of your desires. This is why Neville placed such great emphasis on the emotional state accompanying the wish fulfilled. Praise is not merely a verbal act but an emotional one, a feeling of certainty and gratitude that sets the process of manifestation into motion.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Transformative Power of Praise</strong></h3>
<p>Through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we come to understand that praise is far more than an external expression of worship. It is the internal recognition of our divine power to create and shape our reality through imagination. Praise is the act of aligning ourselves with the creative consciousness that resides within, and through this alignment, we manifest our desires.</p>
<p>By examining the stories of Judah, Tamar, and Perez, we see that praise is not just about outward ritual but about recognising and affirming the divine potential within us. Judah’s lineage, Perez’s breakthrough, and Tamar’s persistence all speak to the power of imagination and faith in the creative process.</p>
<p>When we praise, we engage with the divine potential within us, acknowledging that our desires are already fulfilled in the realm of imagination. This act of praise aligns us with the creative forces of the universe, allowing us to bring our desired realities into being.</p>
<p>So, as you move forward on your manifestation journey, remember that praise is a powerful tool. Praise the power of imagination, praise the divine potential within you, and most importantly, praise the fulfilment of your desires as though they are already realised. This is how we truly manifest the life we desire — through the act of praise, which is the recognition of the creative power within.</p>
