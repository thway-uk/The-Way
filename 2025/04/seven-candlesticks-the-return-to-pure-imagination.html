<h1>Seven Candlesticks: The Return to Pure Imagination</h1>
<blockquote>“And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man…”<br /> — Revelation 1:13<br /><br />“The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks among the seven golden candlesticks.”<br /> — Revelation 2:1</blockquote><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, the Bible is not a history of people but a symbolic revelation of <strong>the mind's journey from ignorance to illumination</strong>. The seven golden candlesticks in Revelation are symbols of this journey: the restoration of imagination to its <a href="/p/genesis-1-creation.html">original creative purity</a>, as described in Genesis.</p><hr /><h3>The Original Creative Act</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”</em></p>
</blockquote>This is not external cosmology, but an inward creative pattern.<br /> The <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">Spirit of God</a>—your own wonderful human imagination—moves upon the waters, which represent the subconscious mind.<br /> Creation begins as pure imagining, untouched by distortion.<p>Then comes the decree:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Let us make <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man in our image</a>.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not spoken by distant gods, but by <strong>the inner creative faculties of man</strong>.<br /><a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">Man</a> is the dreamer, the image, and the God who forms it.</p><hr /><h3>The Seven Candlesticks: Stages of Illumination</h3>In Revelation, the <a href="/2025/07/revelation-vision-of-divine-man.html">Son of Man</a> walks among seven golden candlesticks.<br /> This is not a future event. It is the present unfolding of awareness.<br /> Each candlestick is a degree of light restored—a stage of recognising that consciousness is the only reality.<p>These candlesticks echo the <strong><a href="/p/genesis-1-creation.html">seven days of creation</a></strong>—each one a level of restored vision, from first light to final rest.<br />
But they also reflect <strong>a casting out</strong>: for light to return, distortion must be removed.</p><hr /><h3>Mary Magdalene: The Waters Purified</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he cast out of her seven demons.”</em> (Luke 8:2)</p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s interpretation, these demons are not entities, but <strong>states of mind</strong>—false beliefs that block the flow of creative power.<br /><a href="/2025/04/the-seven-devils-cast-out-of-mary.html">Mary Magdalene</a> personifies <strong>the <a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html">receptive</a> hidden mind</strong>—the waters beneath the Spirit.<br />
Before she is purified, those waters are disturbed, crowded with fear, doubt, and misidentification.</p><p>When the demons are cast out, <strong>the waters are cleansed</strong>.<br />
She becomes once more the <strong>faithful mirror</strong> of the imaginal act.</p><p>Jesus, walking among the candlesticks, is the awakened imagination — the light that knows itself.<br />
Mary Magdalene, from whom seven distortions were cast out, is the soul made ready — a consciousness now able to receive and reflect that light without interference.</p><p>Neville taught:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The <a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html">receptive mind</a> gives form to our desires and expresses them on the screen of space.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When the subconscious is purified—personified by the healing of Mary—<strong>manifestation becomes certain</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>The Complete Symbol</h3><p>Thus, the three symbols are one:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The candlesticks</strong>: the stages of conscious light restored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The seven demons</strong>: the falsehoods that once distorted the waters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>: the subconscious, made whole.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Jesus walking among the candlesticks is <strong>Imagination, fully conscious</strong>, moving on <strong>waters now made still</strong>—ready to reflect and bring forth.</p><p>Creation begins again, but now in awareness.<br />
Man imagines <strong>as God imagined</strong>: freely, faithfully, and without obstruction.</p>
