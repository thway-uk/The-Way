<h1>33 Bible Statements For Manifestation: Through the Voice of Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>The Bible is not a moral instruction manual—it is a <strong>code of consciousness</strong>. Every divine “I” is your <strong>I AM</strong> speaking. Every line attributed to God is the voice of <strong>your imagination</strong>, inviting you to embody a new state.</p><p>At the centre of all Scripture stands a simple yet thunderous phrase—God’s name itself:</p><hr /><h2><strong>"I AM THAT I AM"</strong></h2><p><em>Exodus 3:14</em><br />
This is the hidden name of God—<strong>consciousness aware of itself</strong>. Declare “I AM” followed by anything, and you breathe life into it. That is the law and the promise.</p><hr /><p>Throughout both Old and New Testaments, this divine truth echoes again and again—calling you to awaken:</p><hr /><h2><strong>"I am with you—do not be afraid."</strong></h2><p><em>Isaiah 41:10</em><br />
The presence of God is your <strong>awareness of being</strong>. When you feel fear, you’ve left your true dwelling place. Return to the I AM—the only presence that creates—and fear dissolves.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"You are fearfully and wonderfully made."</strong></h2><p><em>Psalm 139:14</em><br />
This is a metaphysical reminder: You are <strong>imagination clothed in flesh</strong>. Your ability to assume a new state and call it real is the most sacred gift.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"No weapon formed against you shall prosper."</strong></h2><p><em>Isaiah 54:17</em><br />
A weapon is any <strong>condition that contradicts your desired state</strong>. If you hold your assumption faithfully, all opposition is shadow—form without substance.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"You are more than a conqueror."</strong></h2><p><em>Romans 8:37</em><br />
The conqueror fights; the manifestor <strong>imagines</strong>. You surpass the world when you no longer react, but create from within.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"I know the plans I have for you..."</strong></h2><p><em>Jeremiah 29:11</em><br />
Desire is the plan. It is not random—it is <strong>divine compulsion</strong>. Enter into the feeling of the fulfilled plan, and you walk in step with the Creator.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"My grace is sufficient for you."</strong></h2><p><em>2 Corinthians 12:9</em><br />
Grace is the <strong>effortless movement of consciousness</strong>. Once assumed, the state contains within it all the means of fulfilment. You do not strive—grace carries.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"You are the light of the world."</strong></h2><p><em>Matthew 5:14</em><br />
Your assumptions are the world’s illumination. <strong>Change your self-concept</strong>, and you change the entire atmosphere around you.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"I have given you authority..."</strong></h2><p><em>Luke 10:19</em><br />
To accept a new state of consciousness is to receive <strong>authority</strong>. Nothing happens unless you consent. This is power—not over others, but over reality itself.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"You did not choose me—I chose you."</strong></h2><p><em>John 15:16</em><br />
Desire is not initiated by ego—it is <strong>revelation</strong>. The state itself calls you. When you answer through imagination, you enter your anointed role.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Be strong and courageous—I am with you."</strong></h2><p><em>Joshua 1:9</em><br />
Strength is staying faithful to the unseen. Courage is persisting in the inner world while the outer still reflects the old. “I Am with you” means: <strong>the Creative Power walks as you</strong>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Let the weak say, I am strong."</strong></h2><p><em>Joel 3:10</em><br />
This is the law of assumption in one verse. You do not speak what you feel—you speak what you <strong>choose to be</strong>. The spoken word, when believed, becomes flesh.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."</strong></h2><p><em>Proverbs 23:7</em><br />
The heart is the subconscious. Whatever belief lives there becomes your identity. <strong>Change the inner conversations</strong>, and you change the life.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Call those things which be not as though they were."</strong></h2><p><em>Romans 4:17</em><br />
Imagination creates by <strong>calling</strong>. You don’t wait for evidence—you <strong>speak and live as though it is already true</strong>. That is the nature of faith.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"All things are possible to him who believes."</strong></h2><p><em>Mark 9:23</em><br />
This is not poetic exaggeration—it is <strong>literal metaphysics</strong>. Belief is imagination held with conviction. Whatever you accept as true becomes lawful.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"You shall decree a thing, and it shall be established."</strong></h2><p><em>Job 22:28</em><br />
Decree is not begging—it is <strong>inner command</strong>. Speak it with feeling, and the subconscious receives it as law.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."</strong></h2><p><em>Luke 6:45</em><br />
Your speech reveals your state. Listen carefully: your <strong>outer words reflect the inner assumptions</strong> you live from.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life."</strong></h2><p><em>Proverbs 4:23</em><br />
The subconscious does not discriminate. It accepts whatever is impressed upon it. Guard it—not with fear, but with <strong>focus</strong>. Think only from what you want to become.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Be transformed by the renewing of your mind."</strong></h2><p><em>Romans 12:2</em><br />
Transformation is not effort—it is <strong>identification</strong>. Renew the mind by assuming the state of the wish fulfilled. That is rebirth.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"According to your faith be it unto you."</strong></h2><p><em>Matthew 9:29</em><br />
Not as you have <em>hoped</em>, but as you have <strong>believed</strong>. Imagination plus belief is the seed; the harvest is inevitable.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"The kingdom of God is within you."</strong></h2><p><em>Luke 17:21</em><br />
The kingdom is not a place—it is a <strong>state</strong>. Every possibility exists within you now. When you imagine a new world, you enter it. And the outer must follow.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Jesus’ Words: The I AM in Action</strong></h2><p>Jesus did not preach religion—he <strong>embodied principle</strong>. Every “I AM” on his lips was an invitation to awaken your own.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Before Abraham was, I AM."</strong></h2><p><em>John 8:58</em><br />
This was not a claim to lineage—it was a revelation of eternal being. The “I AM” precedes all history, all identity, all condition. It is the root of creation, and it is <strong>within you</strong>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"According to your word, be it unto you."</strong></h2><p><em>Luke 1:38</em><br />
Mary’s response to the angel is the model of <strong>inner consent</strong>. She did not strive—she agreed. Creation begins when you inwardly say <em>yes</em>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."</strong></h2><p><em>John 15:7</em><br />
To abide is to <strong>dwell in a state</strong>. When your inner speech matches your desire, and you remain faithful, the world conforms.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"It is done unto you as you have believed."</strong></h2><p><em>Matthew 8:13</em><br />
Not as you have <em>hoped</em>, but as you have <strong>believed</strong>. Imagination plus belief is the seed; the harvest is inevitable.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."</strong></h2><p><em>John 6:63</em><br />
Words are not sound—they are <strong>spirit</strong>. The inner word, when fused with feeling, animates the invisible into form.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"He that believes in me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do..."</strong></h2><p><em>John 14:12</em><br />
Jesus never called for worship—he invited <strong>imitation</strong>. The “me” is the state of awakened imagination. Enter that state, and miracles become mundane.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Your faith has made you whole."</strong></h2><p><em>Luke 8:48</em><br />
Wholeness is not earned—it is <strong>accepted</strong>. The moment you embody the state of already being healed, restored, or fulfilled, it is done.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Do you believe I am able to do this?"</strong></h2><p><em>Matthew 9:28</em><br />
The power never left your hands. The question is always: can you <strong>accept the state as real now</strong>?</p><hr /><h2><strong>"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."</strong></h2><p><em>Matthew 24:35</em><br />
Conditions shift. The outer world crumbles and reforms. But the <strong>inner Word</strong>—the assumption—remains and manifests in divine timing.</p><hr /><h2><strong>"I came that they may have life, and have it more abundantly."</strong></h2><p><em>John 10:10</em><br />
Life, in its fullest sense, is the <strong>awakened use of imagination</strong>. Abundance is not a reward—it is the natural result of assuming the God-state.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Divine Secret Hidden in Plain Sight</strong></h2><p>All of Scripture circles around this one truth: <strong>I AM is God</strong>. Every promise, every miracle, every character in the Bible exists to reveal this mystery. You are not meant to worship it—you are meant to <strong>use it</strong>.</p><p>As Neville Goddard said:</p><p><strong>"God became man that man may become God."</strong></p><p>So stop waiting for the Word to come to pass. <strong>Speak it. Assume it. Embody it.</strong><br />
That is how the Word becomes flesh—in <strong>you</strong>.</p><p><br /></p>
