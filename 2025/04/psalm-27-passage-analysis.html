<h1>Psalm 27: Passage Analysis</h1>
<blockquote><p>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom am I to fear?<br />
The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom am I afraid?</p>
<p>When evil-doers came on me to put an end to me, even my haters and those who were against me, they were turned back in fear.</p>
<p>Even if an army comes against me, my heart will have no fear: even if war is made on me, I will put my trust in him.</p>
<p>One thing have I asked from the Lord, and will go on searching for: that I may be living in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to see the Lord’s beauty, and to make search for him in his Temple.</p>
<p>For in the time of trouble, he will keep me safe in his tent; in the secret place of his tent will he put me in a high place.</p>
<p>And now my head will be lifted up above those who are round me; and I will make offerings in his tent with cries of joy; I will make a song, truly I will give praise to the Lord.</p>
<p>O Lord, let the voice of my cry come to your ears: have mercy on me, and give me an answer.</p>
<p>When you said, Make search for my face, my heart said to you, For your face will I make my search.</p>
<p>Let not your face be covered from me; do not put away your servant in wrath: you have been my help; do not give me up or take your support from me, O God of my salvation.</p>
<p>When my father and my mother are turned away from me, then the Lord will be my support.</p>
<p>Make your way clear to me, O Lord, guiding me by the right way, because of my haters.</p>
<p>Do not give me into their hands, because false witnesses have come out against me, and men breathing destruction.</p>
<p>I had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessing of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
<p>Let your hope be in the Lord: take heart and be strong; yes, let your hope be in the Lord.</p></blockquote><p>Psalm 27 is a powerful declaration of <strong>inner security</strong> that flows from a deep awareness of the power of <strong>imagination</strong>. In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this psalm serves as a reminder of the importance of <strong>dwelling in the assumption of the wish fulfilled</strong>. Each verse speaks to an aspect of how we, as creators, can live in the conscious knowledge that we have dominion over the conditions of our lives. Let’s explore this psalm verse by verse, with Neville Goddard’s ideas in mind.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Lord is My Light and Salvation</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom am I to fear?"</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>the Lord</strong> is not an external entity but <strong>your own consciousness</strong>. Your <strong>light</strong> is your awareness of being; it is your <strong>imagination</strong>. This verse is a powerful statement that when you are aware of your true creative power, there is <strong>nothing to fear</strong>. Fear only exists when we forget that we are the creators of our experience. With imagination as our guiding light, fear dissipates.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Fearlessness in the Face of Adversity</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"When evil-doers came on me to put an end to me, even my haters and those who were against me, they were turned back in fear."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s interpretation, this verse speaks to the <strong>external world’s opposition</strong>—the doubts, fears, and negative circumstances that seem to appear when we make a shift in consciousness. The “evil-doers” represent the <strong>thoughts and external events that try to oppose the assumption of the wish fulfilled</strong>. However, when you persist in your assumption, these oppositions are turned back. <strong>Your inner state of faith in your imagination</strong> overcomes the forces that appear to be against you.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Power of Unwavering Trust</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"Even if an army comes against me, my heart will have no fear: even if war is made on me, I will put my trust in him."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse reveals the <strong>absolute trust</strong> you must have in your imagination as the creative power. In the face of <strong>circumstances or inner conflict</strong>, trust in your power to <strong>assume the state of the wish fulfilled</strong>. As Neville teaches, the <strong>imagination</strong> is the only power that can influence the outer world, so when you stand firm in your assumption, the external world has no choice but to conform.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Seeking the House of the Lord</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"One thing have I asked from the Lord, and will go on searching for: that I may be living in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to see the Lord’s beauty, and to make search for him in his Temple."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The “house of the Lord” symbolises the <strong>state of consciousness</strong> where you are always aware of your creative power. The “beauty” you are searching for is the <strong>state of fulfilled desire</strong>. Neville often emphasised that in order to manifest what you desire, you must <strong>dwell in the state of the wish fulfilled</strong>, living from it as though it is already a present reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Secret Place</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"For in the time of trouble, he will keep me safe in his tent; in the secret place of his tent will he put me in a high place."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <strong>secret place</strong> is the <strong>imagination</strong>—the inner sanctum where you align yourself with your desired state. In times of external trouble or doubt, <strong>the imagination becomes your refuge</strong>. It is in the secret place that you elevate yourself <strong>above the world of appearances</strong>. Neville Goddard teaches that when you live in the assumption of the desired state, you are placed “in a high place,” which means you transcend the limits of the external world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Courage in the Face of Opposition</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"And now my head will be lifted up above those who are round me; and I will make offerings in his tent with cries of joy; I will make a song, truly I will give praise to the Lord."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse speaks to the <strong>joy and confidence</strong> that come from living in the state of the wish fulfilled. The act of <strong>praise</strong> is akin to the <strong>acknowledgment of your own creative power</strong>. When you praise, you are affirming your belief in the <strong>truth of your imagination</strong>. Neville teaches that when you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you are naturally lifted up and elevated above any external limitations.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Seeking God’s Face</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"When you said, Make search for my face, my heart said to you, For your face will I make my search."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>seeking the face of God</strong> is about turning inward to <strong>discover the creative power within</strong>. The face of God is your own <strong>imagination</strong>, the source of all creation. By seeking God’s face, you are acknowledging that <strong>your imagination is the key</strong> to shaping your world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>When All Else Fails, God is My Support</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"When my father and my mother are turned away from me, then the Lord will be my support."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In times of abandonment or hardship, Neville would say that <strong>you must rely entirely on your imagination</strong>. External sources of support—family, friends, society—may let you down, but <strong>your inner power remains</strong>. The “Lord” is <strong>your inner creative faculty</strong>. It is always with you, and when you align yourself with it, you become your own support.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Trust in the Process</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"I had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessing of the Lord in the land of the living."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse acknowledges the <strong>temptation to give up</strong> when the desired manifestation hasn’t yet materialised. But Neville teaches that <strong>you must persist</strong> in faith, regardless of appearances. Even when hope seems lost, it is the unwavering belief in the unseen that brings your desire into the physical world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Hope and Strength in the Lord</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>"Let your hope be in the Lord: take heart and be strong; yes, let your hope be in the Lord."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Hope, in Neville’s teachings, is <strong>the feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>. It is the <strong>assumption</strong> of your desire as already accomplished. This final verse is a call to <strong>remain steadfast</strong>, knowing that your <strong>hope (imagination)</strong> is the strength that will bring your desires to fruition.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Power of Imagination and Faith</strong></h2><p>Psalm 27 is a powerful reminder of the <strong>dominance of imagination</strong> in our lives. Neville Goddard teaches that by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled and dwelling in the secret place of imagination, we <strong>create the world we wish to see</strong>. The psalm invites us to trust in the power of our own creative consciousness and to stand firm, knowing that <strong>the Lord, our imagination</strong>, is our light, our salvation, and our strength.</p><p>Live from the assumption of your desired state, and the external world will be forced to conform. <strong>This is the power of imagination</strong>.</p>
