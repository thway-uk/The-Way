<h1>Pharaoh: Stubborn and Resistant Rulership</h1>
<p>Pharaoh is a central figure in the Biblical narrative, particularly in the story of Moses and the Exodus. His interactions with Moses, his repeated refusals, and his eventual downfall have been interpreted in various ways throughout history. However, when we view Pharaoh’s role through Neville Goddard’s teachings on the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, we gain a psychological understanding of his character as a reflection of our internal conflicts and assumptions.</p>
<h3>Pharaoh: The Manifestation of Fixed Assumptions</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard's framework, characters in the Bible represent <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">states of consciousness</a></strong>, and Pharaoh is no different. Pharaoh can be seen as a symbol of <strong>the fixed assumption</strong>—a mental state that is resistant to change. This represents the <strong>stubbornness</strong> of the human mind when it is deeply attached to old beliefs and perceptions of reality.</p>
<p>Pharaoh's repeated rejection of Moses' request to free the Israelites reflects our own resistance to <strong>releasing old, limiting beliefs</strong>. In this sense, Pharaoh represents the <strong>ego</strong> or the fixed mindset that clings to the old state of being, which resists the transforming power of imagination and new assumptions.</p>
<p>When we look at the story of Pharaoh’s heart being hardened, we understand it as a <strong>metaphor for internal resistance</strong>—a representation of how our assumptions can keep us stuck in old patterns and ways of thinking. The <strong>hardening of Pharaoh’s heart</strong> is not an external force imposed by God but an <strong>internal struggle</strong> that we face when we refuse to allow new, expansive possibilities to take root within us.</p>
<h3>The Lord and Pharaoh: Two Sides of the Same Coin</h3>
<p>One of the more perplexing aspects of Pharaoh’s story is the apparent contradiction in the Bible: Pharaoh’s heart is hardened both by himself and by God. In Exodus 9:12, it is written: <em>“But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said to Moses.”</em> On the surface, this suggests that God plays an active role in Pharaoh’s resistance. However, when viewed through Neville Goddard’s teachings, this contradiction begins to make sense.</p>
<p>In Neville’s framework, <strong>God</strong> represents <strong>the imagination</strong>—the creative power within us that shapes our reality. Pharaoh, on the other hand, represents <strong>the fixed state of mind</strong> that resists change and transformation. <strong>The Lord hardening Pharaoh’s heart</strong> is a reflection of how our own assumptions about the world and ourselves can <strong>reinforce the old state</strong>. When we refuse to shift our assumptions, we essentially “harden” our own hearts, locking ourselves into a reality that mirrors those fixed beliefs.</p>
<p>In this sense, Pharaoh and the Lord are not separate forces but two aspects of the same process. <strong>The resistance Pharaoh feels</strong> is the same resistance we experience when we cling to the old and refuse to embrace the power of imagination. The story shows how <strong>the power of imagination</strong> (the Lord) can bring about change, but only when we are willing to let go of the old state (Pharaoh’s hardened heart).</p>
<h3>The Ten Plagues: Breaking Down Old Assumptions</h3>
<p>The ten plagues that Pharaoh endures are symbolic of the inner turmoil that occurs when we resist the shift in our assumptions. Each plague can be seen as a <strong>challenge to our fixed beliefs</strong>, a test that forces us to confront the limitations we have placed on ourselves. As Pharaoh stubbornly rejects Moses’ requests, he faces each of these plagues, which represent the consequences of holding onto old, restrictive beliefs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Blood</strong> (Exodus 7:20-21) - The transformation of life into something lifeless represents the way our old assumptions block the flow of creative potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Frogs</strong> (Exodus 8:2-4) - The overwhelming nature of our internal resistance when we refuse to release outdated beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Gnats</strong> (Exodus 8:16-17) - The tiny but pervasive effects of limiting beliefs that we often ignore until they become overwhelming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Flies</strong> (Exodus 8:21-24) - How our resistance to change can cause our lives to become chaotic and unmanageable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Livestock Disease</strong> (Exodus 9:3-6) - The depletion of our potential when we hold onto outdated and limiting assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Boils</strong> (Exodus 9:9-11) - The physical manifestation of internal resistance and self-sabotage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Hail</strong> (Exodus 9:18-26) - The breaking down of old structures that no longer serve us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Locusts</strong> (Exodus 10:12-15) - The overwhelming power of limiting beliefs that consume our potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of Darkness</strong> (Exodus 10:21-23) - The spiritual blindness we experience when we refuse to release the old assumptions and align with the new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Plague of the Firstborn</strong> (Exodus 12:29-30) - The symbolic death of the old self that must occur before we can embrace the new state of consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these plagues represents the internal battle we face as we attempt to break free from the old, entrenched assumptions that keep us stuck in our current state of mind.</p>
<h3>Pharaoh’s Downfall: A Lesson in Assumption and Transformation</h3>
<p>Ultimately, Pharaoh’s downfall occurs when he <strong>finally releases his grip on the old assumptions</strong>. In Exodus 12:31, Pharaoh commands the Israelites to leave: <em>“During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, ‘Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.’”</em> This marks the moment of <strong>transformation</strong>—the shift in Pharaoh’s state of consciousness, where he finally allows the change to occur.</p>
<p>This release mirrors the moment when we shift our assumptions and allow new possibilities to manifest. Just as Pharaoh eventually <strong>lets the Israelites go</strong>, we too must release the <strong>old limiting beliefs</strong> and embrace the power of imagination (worship the Lord) to shape our desired reality.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Pharaoh as a Symbol of the Ego and Fixed Assumptions</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>Pharaoh</strong> represents the <strong>ego</strong> and the <strong>fixed assumptions</strong> that keep us trapped in outdated mental states. The tension between Pharaoh and Moses represents the internal struggle we face when we are confronted with the choice to <strong>shift our assumptions</strong> and embrace the creative power within us.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lord’s role</strong> in hardening Pharaoh’s heart is symbolic of the <strong>power of imagination</strong>, which can create transformation, but only if we are willing to let go of the old and embrace the new. Pharaoh’s ultimate release of the Israelites shows us that we can break free from the limitations of our past assumptions and move forward into new possibilities when we embrace the power of imagination and the Law of Assumption.</p>
