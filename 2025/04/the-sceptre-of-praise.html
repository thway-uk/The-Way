<h1>The Sceptre of Praise</h1>
<p><strong>Moved </strong></p><p><strong>“The sceptre shall not depart from Judah...”</strong> —Genesis 49:10</p><p>At the heart of the Bible lies a profound psychological drama of consciousness. Judah’s sceptre is more than a symbol of royal power; it is the <strong>authority of the masculine principle</strong> within the soul — the inner “I Am” that wields the law of assumption to manifest reality.</p><p>Neville Goddard’s teaching illuminates this sceptre as the creative rod of dominion, sustained by the feeling of praise and the persistent assumption of the fulfilled desire.</p><hr /><h3>Judah: The Embodiment of the Masculine ‘I Am’ and Creative Authority</h3><p>Judah’s name means “He shall be praised,” signalling that his dominion is founded on praise — not passive worship but the <strong>active feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>. The sceptre in Judah’s hand is the <strong>law of assumption in action</strong>: the masculine consciousness holding firm to its imagined reality, shaping the world from within.</p><hr /><h3>The Male Narrative in the Song of Solomon as Judah’s Inner Story</h3><p>The Song of Solomon is a poetic unfolding of the masculine principle’s journey — the very essence of Judah’s sceptre brought to life. The male figure in the Song symbolizes the <strong>creative ‘I Am’ consciousness</strong>, the holder of the sceptre and rod, which are metaphors for power, identity, and ruling authority.</p><p>Consider these verses:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon 3:9-10</strong><br />
<em>“King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon... its pillars of silver, its support of gold, its seat of purple.”</em><br />
This regal imagery mirrors the authority Judah’s sceptre represents — the kingly stature of the masculine ‘I Am’ consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon 6:9</strong><br />
<em>“Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?”</em><br />
The “army with banners” evokes dominion and command, the outward expression of Judah’s sceptre’s inner power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon 7:7-8</strong><br />
<em>“Thy stature is like to a palm tree...”</em><br />
The palm tree is a biblical symbol of victory and kingship, reinforcing the male’s victorious rulership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon 8:6</strong><br />
<em>“Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm...”</em><br />
The seal symbolizes identity and divine authority — the mark of the ‘I Am’ who assumes and manifests.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Tamar and the Feminine Soul: The Receptive Partner to Judah’s Masculine Authority</h3><p>Tamar, Judah’s daughter-in-law, represents the <strong>soul’s receptive aspect</strong>—the feminine principle necessary to conceive and bring forth the creative reality assumed by the masculine sceptre. Together, Judah and Tamar portray the sacred union of <strong>masculine dominion and feminine receptivity</strong>, a dynamic essential for manifestation.</p><hr /><h3>Praise as the Sustaining Force of the Sceptre’s Power</h3><p>Judah’s sceptre remains only through the <strong>vibrational state of praise</strong> — the inner certainty that the desired reality is already complete. Neville taught that you must <strong>enter the state and remain faithful to it</strong>; praise is how this faithfulness is maintained.</p><p>Mary’s proclamation in <strong>Luke 1:46</strong>, <em>“My soul doth magnify the Lord,”</em> echoes this principle. To magnify the Lord within is to sustain the masculine creative power of the ‘I Am’ through praise, the very essence of the sceptre.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Sceptre as the Male Creative Principle in the Soul</h3><p>The sceptre in Judah’s hand is the <strong>law of assumption made manifest</strong> — the masculine narrative of the Song of Solomon embodied in spiritual authority and creative power. This sceptre is not a physical object but the inner rod of rulership, held by the ‘I Am’ consciousness that persists in praise and assumes the fulfilment of its desire.</p><p>To wield the sceptre is to embody the male principle of creation: knowing, assuming, and ruling your world from the unshakable feeling of “I Am.”</p>
