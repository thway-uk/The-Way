<h1>The Boy and the Arrows</h1>
<p>The story of David, Jonathan, and Saul in 1 Samuel 20 is far more than a historical account of royal intrigue. When seen through Neville Goddard’s teachings on the Law of Assumption, it reveals an extraordinary allegory of the inner drama that unfolds as we move towards manifesting a new state of being.</p><h2>David: The Desired State</h2><p>David symbolises the imagined state of the wish fulfilled — the new self we long to embody. Throughout the narrative, David’s experiences mirror how we hold an assumption in imagination and nurture it into reality. His fear of Saul reflects the resistance we encounter when trying to maintain a new state of mind against our old, limiting beliefs.</p><blockquote>
<p>“David fled from Naioth in Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, ‘What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?’” (1 Samuel 20:1)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, David’s fear is an assumption of danger — a manifestation of his belief in Saul’s hostility. Neville reminds us that every assumption, whether grounded in fear or faith, shapes the outer world. David's test and his hiding in the field are symbolic of the inner struggles we face when we question the validity of our assumptions.</p><h2>Jonathan: The Higher Self and Faithful Support</h2><p>Jonathan represents the higher self, the unwavering divine awareness that knows the truth of the desired outcome. His immediate assurance to David is a powerful image of faith, the unwavering conviction that holds firm even when appearances suggest otherwise.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Jonathan said to David, ‘Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.’” (1 Samuel 20:4)</p>
</blockquote><p>Jonathan embodies pure support for the wish fulfilled, acting in absolute loyalty and faith. This is the higher self’s role — to encourage, reassure, and align us with our desired reality despite external opposition.</p><h2>Saul: The Old Self and Limiting Beliefs</h2><p>Saul symbolises the old self, the restrictive state of consciousness that resists change. His anger and attempts to harm David represent the inner voices of doubt, fear, and attachment to outdated identities. These are the "old kings" of consciousness, desperately trying to maintain control when a new state threatens to overthrow them.</p><p>When Saul erupts in anger at David’s absence, it reflects how deeply ingrained beliefs can lash out when we try to adopt a new assumption. The stronger the desire to embody the new self (David), the more intense the resistance (Saul).</p><h2>The Arrows: Aiming Toward the Mark</h2><p>Jonathan’s arrows serve as a striking metaphor for our focused intent and alignment. In 1 Samuel 20:20, he says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The arrows represent the direction of consciousness, our focused thoughts and emotions aimed at the desired end. In Hebrew thought, “sin” means to miss the mark, which aligns perfectly with Neville’s teachings that any deviation from the state of the wish fulfilled is "missing the mark."</p><p>When Jonathan shoots the arrows and signals to David, he mirrors the process of testing and aligning our assumptions. If the arrows land far, more internal work is needed; if they land close, our alignment is strong.</p><h2>The Boy: Innocence and Early Manifestation</h2><p>The young boy who retrieves the arrows is symbolic of the early, delicate stages of manifestation. He represents the fragile, childlike beginning of a desire coming into form. His innocence mirrors our often unaware participation in shaping reality through small, faithful actions.</p><blockquote>
<p>“He said to his boy, ‘Run and find the arrows I shoot.’” (1 Samuel 20:36)</p>
</blockquote><p>The boy runs without questioning, embodying the faithful action necessary for manifestation. Even if he does not understand the deeper significance of his task, he moves in trust, just as we often do when nurturing a new assumption.</p><h2>The Field: Space of Possibility</h2><p>The field where David hides and where Jonathan sends the arrows symbolises the space of infinite possibility — the imagination. It is in this field that assumptions are tested, refined, and finally accepted as true. It is here that David must decide whether to hold fast to his desired outcome or succumb to the fear represented by Saul.</p><h2>Escape and Liberation: Shedding Limiting Beliefs</h2><p>Jonathan helping David escape is a powerful image of liberation from the old self. Saul’s pursuit mirrors how old thought patterns try to reclaim dominance, but Jonathan (faith) guides David (the new state) into freedom. This act symbolises the higher self leading us out of constricting beliefs, so that the desired state can live and thrive.</p><h2>Conclusion: Aligning with the Wish Fulfilled</h2><p>The entire narrative of 1 Samuel 20 illustrates Neville Goddard’s central principle: "Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and persist in that assumption until it hardens into fact."</p><p>David embodies the new desired state, Jonathan is the higher self's unwavering faith, and Saul represents inner resistance. The arrows reflect the power of focused intent, and the boy’s innocent action embodies the necessity of small, faithful steps, even when the end is not visible.</p><p>When we align our thoughts, feelings, and actions with our desired outcome, we aim our arrows toward the mark. We act in faith like the boy, guided by the higher self’s unwavering commitment to our vision. We shed old beliefs like David escaping Saul, and we step fully into the new identity.</p><p>Through this rich allegory, we see that the true battle is not external. It is the inner drama of overcoming resistance, sustaining faith, and faithfully moving in the direction of our chosen state. Just as David ultimately overcomes Saul, so too can we overcome every limiting belief by persistently assuming and living in the end.</p>
