<h1>Hanging: It's Symbolism In The Bible</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard's mystical framework, the Bible is not a history book but a symbolic manual for awakening and creative living. Every story and image points to a psychological or spiritual truth within you. One often overlooked but powerful symbol is the act of <em>hanging</em>.</p>
<p>In biblical narratives, hanging is associated with judgement, shame, or divine justice. But when interpreted through Neville's lens, it reveals a deeper truth: to be hanged is to be <em>cut off from the breath of God</em> — from the divine creative power that animates the soul.</p>
<hr />
<h3>God as Breath: The Creative Life Force</h3>
<p>In Neville's teachings, <strong>breath is synonymous with God</strong>. It is the life-giving spirit, the invisible force that sustains creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."<br />
— <em>Genesis 2:7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This "breath of life" is not merely biological; it is consciousness, imagination, and divine power. To breathe is to be animated by God. The creative act, in Neville's system, is the act of imagining — of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>Even God's presence is described in the language of breath and wind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind..."<br />
— <em>Genesis 3:8 (BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wind symbolises the unseen movement of Spirit. Just as the wind animates the world, <strong>God's breath flows through imagination</strong>, empowering us to bring forth our desires.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hanging: The Severing of Spirit</h3>
<p>So what does it mean to be <em>hanged</em>? In both literal and symbolic terms, hanging involves the <strong>cutting off of breath</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"His body shall not remain all night upon the tree... for he that is hanged is accursed of God."<br />
— <em>Deuteronomy 21:23</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Neville's perspective, this is not about divine wrath, but about <strong>spiritual disconnection</strong>. To be hanged is to be in a state where the breath of God — the imagination — is no longer flowing. It is to dwell in dead mental states, lacking the vitality of divine creativity.</p>
<p>This motif carries forward into the New Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."<br />
— <em>Galatians 3:13</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Jesus takes on the "curse" of being cut off — not from God, but from the <strong>old, limited self</strong>. This death is symbolic of transformation: the outer man must hang so that the inner Christ may rise.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Haman: The Trap of Misused Imagination</h3>
<p>The story of Haman in Esther further deepens this symbolism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then said the king, Hang him thereon. So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai."<br />
— <em>Esther 7:10</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haman represents a destructive state of mind — resentment, pride, and fear. He builds gallows for another but ends up hung on them himself. From a Neville perspective, this illustrates the <strong>law of assumption</strong>: what you imagine for others, you attract to yourself.</p>
<p>Negative mental states become the gallows upon which your desires die. When imagination is misused, it severs the flow of divine breath and leads to the manifestation of your own inner turmoil.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wings, Wind, and the Flow of Spirit</h3>
<p>In earlier teachings, Neville likens wings to the <strong>mental faculties</strong> that allow us to direct the wind of Spirit. Wings lift us; hanging suspends us. Wings are motion; hanging is stagnation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles..."<br />
— <em>Isaiah 40:31</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wings symbolise the power to rise above circumstance. To ride the breath of God is to be conscious, imaginative, and alive. Hanging, in contrast, is the death of imagination — the moment we stop believing, creating, and moving with the Spirit.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: Breathe Life Back In</h3>
<p>To be hanged in Scripture is to be disconnected from the breath, the Spirit, the imagination. It is a state of suspended creativity, a spiritual exile. But in Neville Goddard's teachings, the resurrection always follows the crucifixion. The breath always returns.</p>
<p>When you assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, you restore the flow. You reconnect with the divine breath and ride the wind of Spirit. </p>
