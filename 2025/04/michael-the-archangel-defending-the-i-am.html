<h1>Michael the Archangel: Defending the I AM</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard's teachings, Michael represents the inner strength of imagination, embodying the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">"I AM"</a>—the divine creative power within us. The name <em>Michael</em>, meaning "Who is like God?" <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">(I AM!)</a>, underscores the realisation that there is no greater creative force than imagination, the very essence of God’s power working through us.</p><p>The term <em>angel</em> itself means "messenger," and in this context, Michael, as the divine messenger, is sent to remind us of the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">creative power of imagination</a>, particularly in moments of doubt and resistance. Michael appears in the Bible to confront and defend states of opposition to the I AM, rising to reaffirm belief in the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">wish fulfilled</a>, even when external circumstances or inner doubts threaten to derail it.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Daniel 10:13</strong></h3><p><em>"But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia."</em><br />
In this passage, Michael steps in to help overcome spiritual resistance. Similarly, in Neville's interpretation, Michael represents the inner strength of imagination that rises to counteract doubts and limiting beliefs that hinder our manifestation. Michael’s appearance, as the divine messenger, signifies the "I AM" rising in moments of doubt, reminding us of our power to overcome resistance and stay aligned with our desired outcome.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Daniel 10:21</strong></h3><p><em>"But I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince."</em><br />
Michael, the protector, is depicted as supporting the pursuit of divine truth. In Neville’s teachings, Michael, as the spiritual messenger, represents the "I AM" that stands firm in support of our assumption of the wish fulfilled. Michael’s role here reminds us that, in moments of doubt, the divine messenger—our imagination—holds the key to realising our desires, ensuring we remain unwavering in our belief.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Daniel 12:1</strong></h3><p><em>"At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered."</em><br />
Michael’s role in this passage is one of deliverance and protection. In Neville's framework, this "arising" of Michael is the awakening of the "I AM"—our divine creative power—when we face challenges or doubts. The divine messenger rises within us in moments of spiritual distress, reminding us of the power within to manifest our desires and overcome resistance.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jude 1:9</strong></h3><p><em>"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'"</em><br />
Here, Michael does not engage directly with the adversary but defers to divine authority. In Neville’s teachings, this reflects the understanding that while imagination is a powerful creative force, it is always aligned with divine will. Michael’s appearance in this passage represents the "I AM" reminding us that we must trust in the higher power within us to guide our imagination and stay aligned with our desires, avoiding distraction by negativity or doubt.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Revelation 12:7</strong></h3><p><em>"And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back."</em><br />
Michael’s battle with the dragon in Revelation symbolises the struggle between divine will and negativity. In Neville’s interpretation, this passage illustrates the internal battle against doubts, fears, and limiting beliefs that arise during the manifestation process. Michael, as the divine messenger, reminds us of the creative power of imagination, helping us maintain our belief in the wish fulfilled despite internal resistance and external challenges.</p><h3>Michael: The Arising of the "I AM" and the Messenger of Belief</h3><p>Michael, as the embodiment of the "I AM", serves as both a spiritual warrior and the divine messenger who reminds us of our inherent power to manifest. In times of doubt, when we face resistance either from external circumstances or internal disbelief, Michael symbolises the inner strength that rises to reaffirm our belief in the wish fulfilled. He embodies the unwavering belief in the creative power of imagination, even when external forces or inner doubts threaten to undermine it.</p><p>As the messenger (angel) in Neville’s teachings, Michael brings the reminder that imagination is our divine tool of creation. Just as a messenger brings important news, Michael’s role is to remind us that we have the creative power within us to bring our desires into reality. In times of doubt, the "I AM" rises within us, reaffirming the truth of our assumption and guiding us to hold firm in our belief.</p>
<h3>Neville’s Interpretation: Michael as Chief of the Heavenly Hosts</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>Michael</strong> represents the <strong>power of imagination</strong> as the chief and leader of the heavenly hosts. The <strong>heavenly hosts</strong> symbolise the thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions that align with our desires. Just as Michael leads the angels in spiritual battles, imagination leads our thoughts and actions toward manifestation.</p>
<p>Michael’s role as <strong>chief</strong> reflects how imagination <strong>guides</strong> and <strong>directs</strong> our creative power. In times of doubt or resistance, Michael’s leadership reminds us to stay focused on the assumption of the wish fulfilled. He represents the <strong>inner strength</strong> that keeps our imagination aligned with our desires, ensuring our beliefs and actions stay true to our desired outcome.</p>
<p>In Neville’s view, Michael as <strong>chief of the heavenly hosts</strong> is the <strong>dominant force of imagination</strong>, commanding all aspects of our inner world to create the reality we seek.</p>
