<h1>The Lord’s Prayer: Our Father the I AM</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">In Genesis we read: </div><blockquote><p><strong>“And God said, Let us make man in OUR image, like us...”</strong><br />
<em>— Genesis 1:26</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The word <em>“our”</em> is not casual, and it's not pointing to an external congregation. It points to a hidden <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">multiplicity—<strong>the judges and rulers of the inner world</strong></a>. These are not external beings, but the faculties of mind that sit in silent authority over your assumptions, decisions, and self-concept. <em>“Our Father”</em> and <em>“Let us”</em> are echoes of the same truth: <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God is your imagination</a></strong>, and the inner court of your being is where creation begins.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:9</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>“Our Father which art in heaven...”</h3><p>According to Neville Goddard, <em>heaven</em> is not above you—it is <strong>within you</strong>, the realm of imagination. Your Father is not separate from your own being but is the <em><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a></em>—the creative spark that directs your inner world.</p><hr /><h3>“Hallowed be Thy name.”</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Let your name be kept holy.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:9</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You <em>hallow</em> the Name of God by treating it as sacred in speech and thought. The name is “I AM”—and every word that follows it is a declaration of what you become. To speak “I AM sick” or “I AM healed” is to call that condition into being.</p><hr /><h3>“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Let your kingdom come. Let your pleasure be done, as in heaven, so on earth.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:10</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the direct reflection of:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And God said, Let the earth put out grass, plants producing seed, and fruit-trees giving fruit, in which is their seed, by their sort, on the earth: and it was so.”</strong><br />
<em>— Genesis 1:11</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In Genesis 1:11, the seed within itself represents <strong>the <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">creative pattern embedded in imagination before it appears in the world</a></strong>. Heaven and earth are not separate; they operate as mirror and manifestation. <strong>What is sown inwardly must appear outwardly</strong>. <em>“Thy kingdom come”</em> is the seed coming into view—the divine order you <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">imagined now made visible</a>.</p><p>This moment in the Lord’s Prayer reinforces the law shown in Genesis: <strong>inner vision gives birth to outer form.</strong> The seed is always first spiritual (imagination), then natural (experience).</p><hr /><h3>“Give us this day our daily bread.”</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Give us this day bread for our needs.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:11</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Your “bread” is the daily assumption you live on. It's what you feed your inner judges—the thoughts, beliefs, and words you accept. Whether you eat the bread of worry or the bread of confidence is up to you.</p><hr /><h3>“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And make us free of our debts, as we have made those free who are in debt to us.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:12</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forgiveness is the refusal to drag an old state into the present. When you forgive, you are letting go of the mental attachment to who someone (including yourself) <em>used</em> to be.</p><hr /><h3>“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”</h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And let us not be put to the test, but keep us safe from the Evil One.”</strong><br />
<em>— Matthew 6:13</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Temptation is the pull to abandon imagination for facts. It is the voice that says, “Look at the world; it’s hopeless.” To be delivered from evil is to remember that <strong>you are not at the mercy of appearances</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>“For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.”</h3><p>Though not in the earliest manuscripts, this phrase echoes truth: <strong>the entire kingdom is within you</strong>, and the power to manifest it lies in the <em>I AM</em>. When you claim it consciously, the glory of creation is no longer theoretical—it is lived.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Final Thought</strong>:</h3><p>
The Lord’s Prayer is not a request to an external deity. It is <strong>a blueprint for creation through inner alignment</strong>. The same spiritual logic flows through Genesis 1:11 and Matthew 6:10: <em>You imagine, you persist, and the seed takes root in form</em>. The kingdom isn’t coming from the sky. <strong>It grows from within you—if you will only believe.</strong></p>
