<h1>Shift Your Perspective</h1>
<p><i>IMPORTANT! </i></p><p>The first test of the Bible is to see beyond external appearances. At first glance, scripture has the appearance of literal history, but its true secrets lie hidden in the symbolic imagery beneath the surface. One of the Bible’s core themes is the relationship between the inner and outer self. Cain and Abel are not two separate men; they are two aspects of the same being. Similarly, Sarah and Hagar are not two distinct women, but two reflections of a divided consciousness. The Bible is psychological, and uses symbol imagery to speak to the inner processes of man.</p><p>So, forget everything you know about traditional views of God and shift your perspective of the Bible from seeing God as an external ruling entity to understanding it as <em>you</em>, as God, speaking to your own conscious awareness expressed through the various bible characters and rich symbolism. This way, scripture transforms into something deeply empowering and profoundly magical.</p><p>— Hannah</p><blockquote>Be still and know that I AM God - Psalm 46:10 ESV, Exodus 3:14</blockquote>
