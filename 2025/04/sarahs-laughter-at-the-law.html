<h1>Sarah's Laughter at The Law</h1>
<p>In <strong>Genesis 18:11-15</strong>, Sarah laughs when she hears that she will bear a child in her old age. The concept of assuming  <a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a> seems laughable to her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, 'After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this <a href="/2025/05/eden-and-pleasure-sacred-delight-at.html">pleasure</a>?'" (Genesis 18:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville Goddard would interpret Sarah’s laugh as a <strong>reflection of human doubt</strong> when faced with an extraordinary manifestation. It is deep-seated opposition in the <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">heart of the mind</a>. Like many of us, Sarah struggles to accept that <strong>the impossible can become possible</strong> through imagination.</p>
<p>In a twist, when the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">Lord</a> asks why she laughed, Sarah denies it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then the Lord said to Abraham, 'Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' Is anything too hard for the Lord?'" (Genesis 18:13-14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sarah responds, "I did not laugh," but the Lord, with humour, corrects her: "No, you did laugh." (Genesis 18:15)</p>
<p>This exchange highlights how <strong>the concept of the law of Assumption</strong> often leads to disbelief, but also shows that nothing is beyond the power of imagination when aligned with focused attention.</p>
<p>Sarah’s laughter is a reminder that <strong>manifestation often begins with disbelief</strong>. As Neville would point out, even our doubts are part of the process, and with persistence and faith, even the most improbable desires can come to fruition.</p>
