<h1>Tamar and the Art of Déjà Vu: When Coincidence Isn’t Coincidence</h1>

That’s what life sometimes seems to whisper when something uncanny happens. You see a scene unfold that feels oddly familiar. A person says something you've dreamed before. You land in a moment you could swear you’ve already lived.</p><p>That’s not just déjà vu. That’s Tamar.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Veiled Subconscious at the Roadside</strong></h3><p>In the story of Judah and Tamar, Tamar doesn’t charge in with fanfare. She waits, veiled, on the side of the road—mysterious, unannounced, and entirely intentional.</p><p>Neville Goddard would say Tamar represents the subconscious—quiet, patient, reactive. She doesn’t shout; she reflects. And she shows up <em>when the conditions are right</em>. She’s not random—she’s the echo of a state you once assumed. A forgotten desire dressed in disguise.</p><p>Judah doesn’t recognise her. And most of the time, neither do we. Our manifestations arrive wearing masks. They look like strange timing. Awkward situations. “Chance” encounters. But they are the children of our inner world, making their way back to us.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Receipt You Didn’t Know You Left</strong></h3><p>Judah gave Tamar his signet, cord, and staff—symbols of identity, authority, and support. He didn’t realise what he was doing at the time. But when Tamar produces those very items later, he can’t deny it.</p><p>And so it is with us. The “coincidences” that stop us in our tracks? They’re often moments where imagination is handing us the proof. Life brings us the signet back. The mark of something we set in motion, usually while we weren’t paying full attention.</p><p>The only appropriate response?<br />
<em>“She hath been more righteous than I.”</em><br />
Which, in Neville-speak, is basically: <em>My inner world knew what it was doing, even when my outer man had no clue.</em></p><hr /><h3><strong>Breakthrough Isn’t Always Grand. Sometimes It’s Familiar</strong></h3><p>Tamar gives birth to <strong>Perez</strong>, meaning <em>breakthrough</em>. That’s what déjà vu often is: not a spooky glitch, but the subconscious breaking through. The moment your inner world says, <em>“This is yours. You imagined this. You forgot—but I didn’t.”</em></p><p>So next time a moment feels too strange, too timed, too perfect—pause. Smile. You’re not going mad. You’re meeting your own imagination again, veiled, at the roadside.</p><p>Maybe it’s not just coincidence.<br />
Maybe it’s Tamar.</p>
