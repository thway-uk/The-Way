<h1>The Styles of the Four Gospels</h1>
<p>When reading the <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John</a> — it becomes clear that each has a distinct style. Yet beneath their storytelling tone lies a deeper symbolic thread.</p><p>
Each Gospel reveals not just the story of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a>, but the inner path of manifestation and <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">awareness of self</a>.</p>
<h2>The Gospel of Matthew: Authority and Faith</h2>
<p><strong>Surface Tone:</strong><br />
Matthew presents Jesus with a sense of <strong>authority and structure</strong>. His Gospel is orderly, often grouping teachings into clear sections, such as the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7). It places strong emphasis on the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies, showing Jesus as the promised Messiah.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Symbolism:</strong><br />
Matthew represents <strong>faith</strong> — particularly <strong>faith in divine order</strong>.<br />
Faith in manifestation is not blind hoping; it is trust in the perfect sequence of events unfolding beyond the visible scene.<br />
Matthew shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidence in spiritual laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certainty that what is promised will be fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The willingness to leave the "tax booth" (the old life of doubt and calculation) and enter a new state, just as Matthew himself did (Matthew 9:9).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Gospel of Mark: Urgency and Persistence</h2>
<p><strong>Surface Tone:</strong><br />
Mark's Gospel feels urgent and fast-moving. Scenes unfold rapidly, with little pause for reflection. The word <strong>"immediately"</strong> (<em>euthys</em> in Greek) appears over forty times, far more frequently than in the other Gospels.<br />
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mark 1:10 — "And immediately coming up from the water..."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark 1:12 — "Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark 1:18 — "They immediately left their nets and followed Him."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus in Mark acts swiftly, decisively, and without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Symbolism:</strong><br />
This urgency reflects <strong>persistence</strong>.<br />
True persistence is not anxious haste but <strong>relentless momentum</strong> towards a goal.<br />
Persistence in manifestation means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moving forward without hesitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting in faith without second-guessing or dwelling on obstacles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaffirming the desired state consistently, without delay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark teaches that <strong>spiritual persistence moves immediately</strong> — not through recklessness, but through unwavering determination.</p>
<h2>The Gospel of Luke: Compassion and Imagination</h2>
<p><strong>Surface Tone:</strong><br />
Luke's Gospel is rich in detail and emotional depth. It highlights the compassion of Jesus, His care for outsiders, and contains some of the most stirring parables — such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.<br />
Luke writes with a narrative sensitivity that draws the reader into the human experience.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Symbolism:</strong><br />
Luke symbolises <strong>imagination</strong>.<br />
Imagination is the bridge between the present and the unseen, the ability to feel into a new state of being. It requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seeing possibilities where others see barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awakening inner reality through emotional engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embracing and transforming the "outsider" states within ourselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Luke’s Gospel teaches the soul to <strong>paint vividly</strong> the life it longs to manifest.</p>
<h2>The Gospel of John: Mystery and Praise</h2>
<p><strong>Surface Tone:</strong><br />
John’s Gospel stands apart with its mystical and poetic quality. It begins not with a birth narrative but with cosmic proclamation: "In the beginning was the Word..." (John 1:1).<br />
John explores deep spiritual themes — light and darkness, spirit and flesh, unity with the divine — in a timeless voice.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Symbolism:</strong><br />
John represents <strong>praise</strong> — not merely outward worship, but the inward exaltation of divine reality.<br />
Praise in manifestation means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Affirming the greatness of the unseen reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in reverence for the creative word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loving the fulfilled state so profoundly that it becomes more real than current appearances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>John’s Gospel invites the reader into a deep and abiding union with the Word — the creative power itself.</p>
