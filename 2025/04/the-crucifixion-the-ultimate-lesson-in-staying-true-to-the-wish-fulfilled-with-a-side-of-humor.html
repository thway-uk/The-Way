<h1>The Crucifixion: The Ultimate Lesson in Staying True to the Wish Fulfilled (With a Side of Humor)</h1>
<p>Okay, let’s talk about the crucifixion. It’s one of the most epic stories in the Bible, and for Neville Goddard, it’s the ultimate lesson in sticking to your guns—<em>or in this case, your vision</em>—even when things seem <em>awfully</em> painful.</p>
<p>Jesus represents the imagination in Neville’s teachings, and the whole crucifixion scene? It’s a symbol for holding fast to your desired state even when it feels like the universe is mocking you. Like, Jesus is on the cross, the crowd is jeering, and things seem grim, but he's basically saying, “I know what’s happening here. Stay with me, this will work out."</p>
<p>So yeah, being nailed to a cross doesn’t exactly scream <em>“this feels great”</em>—and Neville doesn’t sugarcoat it either. He knows that sticking to your imagination's vision can be <em>intense</em>, and let’s be real, it's usually not all rainbows and sunshine. In <em>The Power of Awareness</em>, he says:</p>
<p><em>"In the end, you will discover that the world is not the cause of your problems, but merely the mirror of your belief. But in the meantime, the world may seem to present a cross to bear in its seeming opposition.”</em></p>
<p>Translation: sometimes it feels like the world is literally nailing you to a cross—but hey, that’s just a reflection of what’s going on inside you. (Talk about a mirror moment.)</p>
<p>Neville also admits that imagination and persistence can be tough. It's like he’s saying, “Yes, your dreams are possible, but are you ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work?” He puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>"The secret of imagining is the secret of God, for imagining creates reality. It is not an easy thing to change your world. You are called upon to endure a momentary hardship, but you will have your reward in the end.”</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard, "The Power of Awareness"</em></p>
<p>In other words: sure, it's hard, but what’s that old saying? "No pain, no gain"? Except here, it’s more like, “No cross, no resurrection.” Stick with it, and you’ll see the payoff!</p>
<p>Now, Neville is also quick to remind us that opposition is part of the deal. You’ll face resistance on the road to manifestation—<em>that’s just the way the cookie crumbles</em>. Neville says:</p>
<p><em>"You will encounter opposition to your desire. But this is part of the process. You must remain faithful to your vision, no matter what comes against you.”</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard, "Feeling is the Secret"</em></p>
<p>It’s like trying to order a pizza on a rainy day when the delivery driver <em>still</em> shows up 30 minutes late—frustrating, yes, but the pizza’s still coming. Same with your dreams. Opposition? It’s just part of the process. Hang in there.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget the best part: the resurrection! This is the moment where your desires <em>finally</em> come to life, like a surprise plot twist. Neville puts it this way:</p>
<p><em>"The resurrection is the unveiling of the individual to himself; the transformation of the individual through the consciousness of being. It is the experience of being what you desire to be.”</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard, "The Resurrection"</em></p>
<p>Basically, after all that crucifixion stuff, you’re going to <em>come back stronger</em>—and your desires will be ready to manifest. Just like Jesus, who didn’t stay on that cross, you don’t stay stuck in the struggle. Keep going, and your vision will be born into reality.</p>
<p>But here’s the kicker: Neville also talks about how, once you’ve stuck with it and lived in the end of your desire, you reach a blissful state. It’s not the "bliss" of avoiding struggle—no, no—but the bliss that comes once you’ve held onto your vision and <em>nailed</em> it. The feeling when the desire finally materialises and you <em>know</em> you did it, like:</p>
<p><em>"The feeling of the wish fulfilled is the secret to all manifestation. When you live in the state of the wish fulfilled, you will find a deep, inner joy, a blissful feeling, that confirms to you that your desire is already yours."</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard, "The Power of Awareness"</em></p>
<p>So there you have it: the crucifixion is not just an ancient story of suffering, but a <em>timeless lesson</em> that, yes, manifestation can be a pain, but sticking to your wish will <em>absolutely</em> bring the breakthrough. Stay true to your imagination, and you’ll come out the other side in full resurrection mode—just with a lot less blood and nails (hopefully). And once that desire lands, get ready for that sweet, sweet feeling of bliss when you realise it’s all been worth it.</p>
