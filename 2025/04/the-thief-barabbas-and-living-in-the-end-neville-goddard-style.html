<h1>"The Thief, Barabbas, and Living in the End: Neville Goddard Style</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard's teachings emphasise the importance of <strong>living in the end</strong>—that is, assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled. According to Neville, manifestation occurs when you consistently focus on the desired outcome, living as if it’s already realised. Neville often highlighted the necessity of staying <strong>mentally focused</strong> on this state and not allowing <strong>other thoughts</strong> to creep in and rob you of your manifestation.</p>
<h3>The Son of Man vs. The Son of God: Choosing Your State of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Neville frequently discussed the difference between the <strong>Son of Man</strong> and the <strong>Son of God</strong> in the Bible. The <strong>Son of Man</strong> represents the <strong>ego</strong> or <strong>lower consciousness</strong>, where thoughts are governed by fear, doubt, and limitation. In contrast, the <strong>Son of God</strong> symbolises the <strong>higher consciousness</strong>, the Christ mind, which aligns with the <strong>truth of your creative power</strong>.</p>
<p>When you live from the <strong>Son of God</strong>, you are confident in your ability to manifest, as this state of consciousness knows all things are possible. To manifest effectively, you must choose this higher consciousness, rather than succumbing to the <strong>Son of Man</strong>, which is often caught up in external circumstances and negativity.</p>
<h3>The Parable of the Thief: Guarding Your Mind</h3>
<p>In <strong>Matthew 24:43-44</strong>, Jesus warns:</p>
<p><em>"But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."</em></p>
<p>Neville interpreted the <strong>Son of Man</strong> as representing the <strong>ego</strong>—the thoughts and fears that can distract us from the state of living in the end. The <strong>thief</strong> in this parable symbolises those <strong>negative, limiting thoughts</strong> that sneak in when we’re not vigilant. Just as a thief steals your possessions, these thoughts can steal your focus, shifting you away from the <strong>fulfilled desire</strong> and back into a state of lack and doubt.</p>
<p>The <strong>house</strong> in the parable represents the <strong>mind</strong>, the container of your awareness. If you don’t guard it carefully, <strong>unwanted thoughts</strong> can invade, stealing your ability to manifest your desires.</p>
<h3>Barabbas: The Thief of Consciousness</h3>
<p>In the Bible, <strong>Barabbas</strong> is described as a <strong>thief</strong> (John 18:40, Mark 15:7, Matthew 27:16). Neville Goddard saw Barabbas as a symbol of the <strong>lower, ego-driven consciousness</strong>, the part of us that clings to fear, limitation, and external circumstances. When the crowd chooses to release <strong>Barabbas</strong> over Jesus, Neville interpreted this as a metaphor for how we often choose the <strong>lower consciousness</strong> over the <strong>Christ consciousness</strong>—the awareness of our creative power.</p>
<p>The <strong>thief</strong>, Barabbas, robs us of our ability to manifest by shifting our focus away from the <strong>fulfilled desire</strong>. These <strong>ego-driven thoughts</strong> steal our power, pulling us out of the higher state of awareness where our desires are already fulfilled. If we let <strong>Barabbas</strong> (the ego) take control, we remain trapped in the limitations of the <strong>lower consciousness</strong>, which obstructs our manifestations.</p>
<h3>Protecting Your Mind: Guarding Against the Thief</h3>
<p>Neville teaches that to manifest successfully, we must remain <strong>focused on the end result</strong> and avoid letting doubt, fear, or any negative thoughts invade our minds. The <strong>thief</strong> represents all the distractions that pull us out of the state of living in the end—those moments of <strong>doubt</strong> that say, “What if this doesn’t work?” or “This is too difficult.”</p>
<p>Just as the homeowner must be vigilant to prevent a thief from breaking in, you must protect your mind from these disruptive thoughts. The more you allow them to take hold, the more you weaken your ability to manifest. To stay focused on your desired outcome, you must refuse to entertain thoughts that contradict it.</p>
<h3>The Cherubim: Guarding the Garden of Your Mind</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Garden of Eden</strong>, <strong>cherubim</strong> were placed to guard the entrance with <strong>flaming swords</strong> (Genesis 3:24), preventing anyone from entering the garden. This represents the idea of <strong>spiritual vigilance</strong>—the importance of guarding the entrance to your mind from unwanted thoughts. Just as the cherubim stood guard to protect the garden, you must guard your mind to protect the state of <strong>fulfilled desire</strong>.</p>
<p>By being vigilant and protecting your mind, you ensure that only thoughts which align with your manifestation are allowed to enter, paving the way for your desires to materialise.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Living in the End and Guarding Your Mind</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard’s teachings remind us that <strong>manifestation</strong> is a process of <strong>living in the end</strong>, staying focused on the <strong>desired outcome</strong>, and <strong>refusing to entertain thoughts that steal</strong> away our power. <strong>Barabbas</strong>, the <strong>thief</strong>, symbolises the <strong>ego-driven thoughts</strong> that can steal your manifestation by pulling you into doubt and fear. The key to manifestation is to stay vigilant—guard your mind, just as the cherubim guarded the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>To manifest effectively, you must keep your thoughts aligned with the <strong>fulfilled desire</strong>, protecting your mind from the <strong>thief</strong> of doubt, fear, and limitation. By doing so, you empower your ability to create and bring your desires into reality.</p>
