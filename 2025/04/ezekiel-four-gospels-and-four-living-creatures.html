<h1>Ezekiel: Four Gospels and Four Living Creatures</h1>
<p>Ezekiel’s vision in Ezekiel 1:4-14, of the four living creatures can be understood, through Neville Goddard’s interpretation, as a kind of imaginal intercession—a symbolic condensation of the journey of <a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">consciousness</a>. In the <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">creation story, that is the first assumption</a>, the appearance and movement of water, land and animals represent the imagination in action. Ezekiel's creatures is the same vision, but now featuring the concepts learned through the <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">stories of the four fathers</a>. It gathers the inner development of spiritual states represented by the patriarchs (<a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">the foundational teachings of manifestation</a>) —faith in Abraham, persistence in Jacob, imagination in Joseph, and praise in Judah—and presents them as a single, living image. These creatures are not external beings but facets of the one divine imagination, the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>, preparing to express itself more fully. What was once hidden within these early figures is now ready to take form as the four Gospels, each one revealing a different aspect of the divine unfolding in <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a>. They represent the <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four foundational stories</a> of manifestation</strong>: <strong>Faith</strong>, <strong>Persistence</strong>, <strong>Imagination</strong>, and <strong>Praise</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>The Four Faces: The Pillars of Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>In Ezekiel’s vision, each of the four creatures has <strong>four faces</strong>—a <strong>man</strong>, a <strong>lion</strong>, an <strong>ox</strong>, and an <strong>eagle</strong>. These faces represent distinct <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">aspects of consciousness</a>, each playing a crucial role in the manifestation process. Each face aligns with a different pillar of manifestation that Neville Goddard taught as essential for creating the reality you desire.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Man: Abraham: Matthew: Faith</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>man face</strong> symbolises the <strong>conscious mind</strong>, where you <strong>decide</strong> what to believe. It is the mental act of <strong>assumption</strong>, where you choose the belief you will hold and trust. Faith is the <strong>foundation</strong> of manifestation because you must first believe in the reality of your desires before they can come to pass. The <strong>man</strong> face represents the <strong>mental decision</strong> to assume and believe that what you desire is already yours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lion: Jacob: Mark: Persistence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>lion face</strong> represents the <strong>courage</strong> and <strong>strength</strong> to persist in the face of obstacles and resistance. When you are committed to your assumption, you must not waver, no matter what the external world presents. The lion’s <strong>roar</strong> can be seen as the inner conviction and determination that your assumption is <strong>true</strong>, regardless of appearances. Persistence means continuing to hold your vision, even when it seems impossible or contrary to present reality. <strong>Persistence</strong> is the unwavering strength to keep imagining your desired outcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ox (Beast): Joseph: Luke: Imagination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>ox face</strong> represents the <strong>labour</strong> of imagination. It is the <strong>inner work</strong> of visualising and keeping your assumption alive. The ox is a symbol of <strong>hard work</strong>, but it also represents the <strong>effort</strong> needed to sustain your mental imagery. Imagination is the creative power through which your desires are <strong>brought into form</strong>, and the ox symbolises the consistent focus and <strong>imagination</strong> needed to manifest your reality. As the ox works tirelessly to plough the fields, so does your imagination tirelessly work to manifest your desires. The beast is the ox before it is domesticated. The ox is ruled by the elevated consciousness symbolised by the lion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eagle: Judah: John: Praise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>eagle face</strong> represents <strong>spiritual elevation</strong> and <strong>gratitude</strong>. The eagle is free, soaring above earthly limitations, representing the <strong>transcendence</strong> of physical reality. Birds of first spoken of in scripture in Genesis 1:20 as a symbol expansion of I<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"> AM</a> - the spirit hovering over the face of the waters (Genesis 1:2). In the manifestation process, <strong>praise</strong>—or <strong>gratitude</strong>—is the acknowledgment of the divine power within you that has already brought your desires into being. As the eagle flies high, you rise above the doubt and disbelief, trusting that your assumptions are manifesting. <strong>Praise</strong> elevates your mind to a higher state of awareness, allowing you to see and accept your desires as already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Wings: Freedom and Spiritual Elevation</strong></h3>
<p>In Ezekiel’s vision, the creatures also have <strong>wings</strong> that stretch upward. These wings represent <strong>spiritual elevation</strong>, <strong>freedom from limitation</strong>, and the <strong>divine inspiration</strong> that comes from connecting with your higher consciousness.</p>
<h4><strong>Symbolism of Wings in the Manifestation Process:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom from Limitation</strong>: The wings enable the creatures to transcend physical boundaries, lifting them above the constraints of the material world. In manifestation, this is symbolic of the <strong>freedom you gain</strong> when you cease to be bound by the limitations of your current reality. When you align your imagination with faith, persistence, and praise, you gain the ability to <strong>transcend</strong> the restrictions of your present circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alignment with Higher Consciousness</strong>: The wings represent the <strong>elevation of the mind</strong>. As you engage in the four pillars of manifestation—faith, persistence, imagination, and praise—you are lifted into a higher state of awareness, transcending the mundane and entering into a <strong>divine state</strong> of creativity. The wings symbolise your <strong>connection</strong> to the infinite, to the universal creative power that lies within you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inspiration and Vision</strong>: Just as the eagle has a clear and far-reaching vision, the wings also represent the <strong>inspiration</strong> that comes from having a clear, expansive view of your desires. When you are attuned to your higher self, you can see beyond the physical world and <strong>visualise</strong> the fulfilment of your desires as if they already exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Many Faces: The Multiplicity of Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>many faces</strong> of the creatures also speak to the <strong>multiplicity of consciousness</strong> required in the manifestation process. Each face represents a different <strong>state of being</strong> that you must embody as you work through the creative process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>man face</strong> represents <strong>faith</strong>—the decision to believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>lion face</strong> represents <strong>persistence</strong>—the courage to continue even in the face of doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>ox face</strong> represents <strong>imagination</strong>—the mental work required to maintain your vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>eagle face</strong> represents <strong>praise</strong>—the spiritual elevation that comes when you acknowledge your desires as already fulfilled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>many faces</strong> are symbolic of the fact that manifestation is not a one-dimensional process. It involves a <strong>multifaceted approach</strong> where all aspects of your mind—conscious, emotional, and spiritual—must work in harmony to bring about your desired results.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: A Unified Approach to Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>The four creatures in Ezekiel’s vision are more than just symbolic figures; they represent the <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">four pillars of manifestation</a></strong>: Faith, Persistence, Imagination, and Praise. Together, they form a <strong>unified approach</strong> to the manifestation process, each one essential in its own right.</p>
<p>By understanding the significance of the <strong>many faces</strong> and <strong>wings</strong>, you can see how all aspects of your consciousness—mental, emotional, and spiritual—must be in harmony to manifest your desires. The <strong>man face</strong> (faith), the <strong>lion face</strong> (persistence), the <strong>ox face</strong> (imagination), and the <strong>eagle face</strong> (praise) work together, with the <strong>wings</strong> providing the <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>spiritual elevation</strong> needed to create a reality aligned with your highest desires.</p>
<p>In embracing these aspects of consciousness and <strong>aligning with your higher self</strong>, you empower your manifestation process, allowing your desires to take flight with the <strong>wings of imagination</strong> and the <strong>faces of faith, persistence, and praise</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Side Note:</strong><br />
The dominance of male patriarchs and male narratives in the Bible is not a reflection of gender, but rather a symbol of the <strong>conscious mind</strong> and its various stages of development. These figures represent universal qualities that are present in everyone, regardless of gender.</p>
