<h1>Rainbow Symbolism: Neville Goddard’s Promise of Fulfilled Desire</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s mystical reading of Scripture, the rainbow isn’t merely a covenant sign in the sky—it’s the living arc of your own consciousness, bridging the unseen realm of desire with its physical fulfillment. Here’s how Neville invites us to see that radiant bow:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Imaginative Covenant</strong><br />
For Neville, every promise from God is first made within your own imagination. The rainbow speaks of a divine agreement between your current state and the reality you choose to assume. As you “see” the colors of your wish fulfilled, you’ve already inscribed that covenant in the depths of your mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectrum of Feeling</strong><br />
Each hue—red for vitality, green for growth, gold for prosperity—mirrors a quality you must embody. Neville teaches that feeling is the secret ingredient: to claim the rainbow’s promise, one must generate in feeling the very state of having, not merely think about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge over the Flood</strong><br />
Just as Noah’s world was purified by the Flood, the rainbow in your psyche signals the end of inner turmoil. By living “as if” your desire is accomplished, you transcend doubt, and imagination becomes the ladder from lower thought‑waves to the bright summit of manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Personal Rainbow</strong><br />
Close your eyes. Envision a radiant arc stretching across your mental sky. Walk beneath it in feeling—as though every color is already woven into your circumstances. That moment of inner conviction is the seal on your promise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and observe the route that your attention follows.”<br />
—Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you apply this teaching, the rainbow ceases to be a distant spectacle and becomes the vivid testimony of your creative power—assuring you that every desire truly awaits its birth in your imagination.</p>
