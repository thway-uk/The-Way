<h1>The Spirit According to Neville Goddard: The Power Behind All Creation</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that the Spirit is not something external to us—it is our own wonderful human imagination. Far from being a vague or ghostly force, Spirit, to Neville, is the living, animating presence that gives form to everything in our world. It is the invisible cause behind all visible effects.</p>
<p>In his lectures, Neville consistently pointed to the Bible’s use of “Spirit” as synonymous with consciousness. “God is Spirit,” he quoted, and went on to clarify that this Spirit is awareness itself. When we imagine, feel, and believe, we are engaging directly with Spirit. It is not bound by time or limitation—it operates according to belief.</p>
<p>For Neville, the Spirit is the creative essence. Just as the wind moves without being seen, so too does imagination shape experience without visible effort. It moves beneath the surface, impressing upon the subconscious and bringing forth manifestation.</p>
<p>When you accept that your imagination <em>is</em> Spirit, you step into the true power of being. You no longer wait for permission or divine intervention—you create. As Neville put it, “Imagination is the divine body in every man,” and Spirit is its breath.</p>
