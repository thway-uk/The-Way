<h1>How We Have the Manual for Life (But Don’t Read It)</h1>
<p><em>Because obviously, we know better…</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>We’ve All Done It</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s be honest: if life came with a manual, most of us would use it as a coaster. Or lose it under the sofa with that one sock, seven pens, and your will to exercise.</p>
<p>And yet—<em>plot twist</em>—it <em>does</em> come with a manual.</p>
<p>A deep, ancient, metaphor-packed, wildly symbolic, occasionally confusing, and definitely misused one: the Bible.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Manual, Misread</strong></h2>
<p>But instead of reading it like the rich spiritual blueprint it is, most people either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Treat it like a rulebook from a cranky cosmic parent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid it entirely because “Leviticus said something weird once”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use it as a prop in dramatic Facebook arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only open it when trying to look spiritual while low-key judging someone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Not Just Sandals and Smiting</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s the truth: the Bible isn’t just about sandals, smiting, or suspicious fish dinners. It’s a <em>manual for consciousness</em>. A map for navigating the mind. A poetic codebook for manifestation, imagination, healing, and transformation.</p>
<p>But we don’t read it. Why?</p>
<p>Because manuals are boring… unless they’re secretly about <em>you</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Gadget Is You</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine buying the fanciest, most powerful gadget in the universe—you—and ignoring the one book that tells you how to use it properly, because <em>“I’ll figure it out.”</em><br />
Spoiler: you don’t.</p>
<p>You just keep pressing random buttons and wondering why the ‘inner peace’ setting won’t turn on.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Manual Speaks (Softly)</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Genesis is over here whispering:<br />
<em>“The seed is in itself… try planting it in imagination instead of panic.”</em></p>
<p>Proverbs chimes in:<br />
<em>“Guard your heart, it controls everything. Maybe stop binge-watching negativity?”</em></p>
<p>And Jesus? Calmly breaking it down with:<br />
<em>“Ask as though you’ve already received it, you lovable chaos gremlin.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>You’re in the Story</strong></h2>
<p>Look, no judgement—we’ve all been there. But maybe it’s time to dust off the manual and <em>actually read it</em>… with spiritual eyes instead of Sunday school trauma.</p>
<p>Because, plot twist number two: you’re not just reading about Moses.<br />
<em>You are Moses</em>.<br />
And Pharaoh.<br />
And the Red Sea.<br />
And the parting.<br />
And the walking through your own nonsense like a boss.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2>
<p>The manual’s been written.<br />
It’s not in the junk drawer.<br />
It’s not in your 57 open tabs.<br />
It’s in you.</p>
<p>(<em>But also… in the manual and this website. Maybe just give it a peek.</em>)</p>
