<h1>City Metaphor: Biblical Symbolism</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard's framework, the Bible is a guide to understanding the inner workings of the human mind. One powerful metaphor he uses is the representation of <strong>cities</strong> as <strong>states of consciousness</strong>. But cities, as we know, aren’t random or spontaneous—they are <strong>built</strong>, <strong>maintained</strong>, and sometimes <strong>destroyed</strong> over time. The same can be said about our mental states and belief systems. Just as cities are shaped by the ideas, cultures, and institutions that form them, so too are our thoughts and beliefs shaped by the mental cities we inhabit.</p><h3>Cities as Subconscious States</h3><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>cities</strong> are often depicted as <strong>feminine</strong>. Why? Because, just as the subconscious mind is the <strong>receptive</strong> and <strong>creative</strong> aspect of consciousness, a city receives and expresses the beliefs, ideas, and perceptions we hold within. The subconscious mind, like a city, is not <strong>proactive</strong> in initiating actions but rather <strong>reactive</strong>, responding to the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs we impress upon it.</p><p>Think of cities as <strong>established thought systems</strong>—mental landscapes where beliefs take root and form the culture of our inner world. These "mental cities" are constructed over time, brick by brick, through our repeated thinking and emotional reinforcement. Once a thought system is established, it requires continuous <strong>maintenance</strong>. The beliefs we hold feed these systems, just as people and resources sustain a physical city.</p><h3>Building and Maintaining Mental Cities</h3><p>Much like the physical cities we live in, the cities of our consciousness are <strong>built</strong> gradually. We are <strong>born</strong> into certain mental environments—thoughts and beliefs passed down from family, culture, and society. These inherited belief systems shape the “city” we first inhabit in our subconscious. The buildings of this city are formed through repeated ideas we’ve internalised, often without even questioning their origins.</p><p>But the <strong>power of choice</strong> lies in our hands. If we are dissatisfied with the “city” we’ve built—if we find ourselves in a mental environment full of fear, confusion, or doubt—we have the ability to <strong>demolish</strong> and <strong>rebuild</strong>. Just as cities can be destroyed and new ones erected in their place, so too can our mental states be <strong>transformed</strong> by changing the beliefs and thoughts we nurture.</p><h3>Adultery and Idolatry in Cities</h3><p>In the Bible, cities are often depicted in terms of <strong>spiritual adultery</strong>, such as in <strong>Ezekiel 16</strong> and <strong>Ezekiel 23</strong>, where Jerusalem and Samaria are portrayed as women who commit infidelity by “taking lovers” from external sources. Neville would interpret this as the subconscious mind accepting <strong>false beliefs</strong> from the outside world, instead of remaining faithful to its divine creative power.</p><p>In this context, <strong>idolatry</strong> is the <strong>acceptance of external authority</strong> or false impressions about who we are and what we can achieve. When we surrender our power to these external influences, we are effectively allowing <strong>foreign ideas</strong> to dictate the beliefs that shape our inner city. This creates confusion and chaos in the subconscious, much like the spiritual decay that accompanies idolatry.</p><h3>Sodom and Gomorrah: The Collapse of Corrupt Consciousness</h3><p>Another example of a <strong>corrupt mental city</strong> in the Bible is <strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong>. These two cities, which were destroyed by divine fire and brimstone, symbolise a <strong>state of consciousness</strong> that has degenerated into <strong>moral decay</strong>, <strong>selfishness</strong>, and <strong>wickedness</strong>. In Neville’s interpretation, these cities represent thought systems dominated by <strong>false values</strong>, <strong>immorality</strong>, and <strong>external attachments</strong> to the pleasures of the world. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah isn’t just a physical event but a <strong>symbolic collapse</strong> of a mind that is out of alignment with divine order and truth.</p><p>Neville often spoke of the importance of <strong>purging</strong> one's consciousness of unproductive, negative thoughts and beliefs—just as Sodom and Gomorrah were purged of their corruption. If the thoughts we entertain are full of <strong>greed</strong>, <strong>hatred</strong>, or <strong>selfish desire</strong>, they will eventually lead to the destruction of the mental "city" we've built. But this collapse isn’t always literal—it may manifest as <strong>inner turmoil</strong>, <strong>mental confusion</strong>, or a <strong>failure to manifest</strong> our desires in the physical world. When a person clings to negative mental cities like Sodom and Gomorrah, they create an environment where their creative power is hindered, and their manifestations are out of harmony with divine truth.</p><p>The <strong>fire and brimstone</strong> of Sodom and Gomorrah can be interpreted as the <strong>purifying fire</strong> that burns away <strong>false beliefs</strong> and <strong>misaligned thoughts</strong>, leaving only the truth behind. Just as the cities were destroyed for their corruption, a <strong>purification of consciousness</strong> is necessary to build new, healthy mental cities aligned with divine order.</p><h3>The Redemption of Cities</h3><p>Just as some cities are plagued by corruption, so too can our thought systems be <strong>redeemed</strong>. A mental city can be restored to its <strong>original purity</strong> when it aligns with the truth of who we are at our core. This is the <strong>New Jerusalem</strong> described in Revelation: a <strong>city of truth</strong> where the consciousness of the individual is fully aligned with the divine power of “I AM.” When we rebuild our mental cities with <strong>truth</strong>, <strong>faith</strong>, and <strong>self-awareness</strong>, we create a state of consciousness where <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>manifestation</strong> flow effortlessly.</p><h3>Israel and Jerusalem: The Spiritual Journey</h3><p>In the Bible, <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Jerusalem</strong> both serve as symbols for spiritual states, but they represent different stages of consciousness.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Israel</strong>, in the Old Testament, represents the <strong>spiritual journey</strong> of the individual. It is the <strong>chosen consciousness</strong>, the people who are on the path to awakening and realising their divine potential. The journey of <strong>Israel</strong>—from bondage in <strong>Egypt</strong> to wandering in the wilderness and ultimately entering the <strong>Promised Land</strong>—symbolises the <strong>evolution of the soul</strong> towards spiritual freedom and self-realisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jerusalem</strong>, particularly in the New Testament, represents the <strong>redeemed consciousness</strong>. It’s the <strong>New Israel</strong>, a <strong>higher state of consciousness</strong> where one has fully realised their divine nature and is now aligned with divine truth. The <strong>New Jerusalem</strong> described in Revelation is the <strong>ultimate state</strong> of spiritual fulfilment, where the individual has fully embraced their creative power and is at peace with the divine I AM.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In this sense, <strong>Israel</strong> marks the beginning of the spiritual journey, while <strong>Jerusalem</strong> represents the <strong>culmination</strong> of that journey—the <strong>redeemed mind</strong> fully aligned with divine purpose.</p><h3>The Power to Build Your City</h3><p>Ultimately, Neville Goddard teaches us that we are not <strong>prisoners</strong> of the cities we inhabit. Through the <strong>imaginative use of our conscious mind</strong>, we have the power to <strong>change</strong> the mental cities we live in. By consciously choosing the thoughts we <strong>entertain</strong> and the beliefs we <strong>hold</strong> dear, we can <strong>build new cities</strong> that reflect the highest version of ourselves.</p><p>Your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs are the <strong>bricks</strong> that form your mental city. If you don’t like the city you’ve built—tear it down and start again. Construct a new city based on <strong>faith</strong>, <strong>love</strong>, and the <strong>truth of your divine imagination</strong>. By doing so, you are not just changing your mental landscape; you are creating the life you truly desire.</p><p><br /></p>
