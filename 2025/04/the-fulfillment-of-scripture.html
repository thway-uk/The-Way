<h1>The Fulfillment of Scripture</h1>
<p><strong>The Bible as a Guide to Manifesting Your Divine Potential</strong></p>
<p>What if the stories in the Bible weren’t simply tales of ancient people, but symbolic instructions for you—the individual—on how to manifest the life you truly desire?</p>
<p>In the teachings of Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a religious rulebook but a psychological blueprint. It presents a journey of inner transformation, where every character and event reflects a state of consciousness. Abraham represents faith. Jacob embodies persistence. Joseph symbolises imagination. Judah stands for praise. These aren't just men—they are <em>you</em>, in various stages of realisation.</p>
<p>The Bible, when read with spiritual perception, teaches that life doesn't happen to you; it happens through you. The outer world is a shadow cast by the inner world. By consciously directing your states—aligning your thoughts, feelings, and assumptions—you shape the path ahead.</p>
<p>This isn't wishful thinking. It's the Source, God, unfolding through the individual. It’s the divine Self learning to express itself with clarity, intention, and love.</p>
<p>The ultimate manifestation is not just a dream home, a relationship, or a career. It is the revelation of who you truly are—the Word made flesh. And that, as Neville would say, is <em>the fulfilment of Scripture</em>—the full manifestation of your divine potential.</p>
