<h1>Solomon’s Rise: Summary</h1>
<p>The third chapter of First Kings marks a pivotal moment in <a href="/search/label/Solomon%20Series">Solomon’s</a> story. It’s the turning point from inheritance to embodiment, from being king by name to ruling with the wisdom of assumption. Interpreted through Neville Goddard’s teachings, this chapter is not just history—it is a profound lesson in how <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a> creates reality.</p>
<h3>Solomon’s Marriage to Pharaoh’s Daughter (1 Kings 3:1)</h3>
<p>Solomon marries Pharaoh’s daughter and brings her into the City of David. In Neville’s symbolism, Egypt represents the outer world of appearances and conditioning—Pharaoh is the archetype of external authority. Solomon’s union here reflects the inevitable engagement between inner awareness and outer form. This is the stage where the spiritual journey includes acknowledging the influence of the world’s facts and structures.</p>
<h3>Solomon Loved the LORD but Sacrificed at High Places (1 Kings 3:3)</h3>
<p>Though Solomon loves the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">LORD</a> (the I AM presence), he still offers sacrifices at high places—external rituals. Neville would say this represents those who love truth but still try to change their inner state through outer means. This tension stirs Solomon into a deeper awakening, preparing him for the next step: the dream.</p>
<h3>The Dream at Gibeon: Requesting an Understanding Heart (1 Kings 3:5–15)</h3>
<p>God appears to Solomon in a dream, offering to grant him whatever he asks. This dream is symbolic of the imaginative realm where inner states are chosen and solidified into reality. Solomon asks not for wealth or power, but for an understanding heart—the wisdom to discern truth from falsehood.</p>
<p>In Neville’s terms, this is the Law of Assumption in action. Solomon chooses the state of <strong>knowing</strong>, not hoping or fearing. He claims the power to assume the wisdom needed to govern his reality from within. The promise follows: because he asked for this, God also grants riches and honour.</p>
<h3>The Judgment Between Two Mothers (1 Kings 3:16–28)</h3>
<p>Next comes the famous story of two <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">women</a> claiming one living child. Solomon’s proposal to divide the child is a profound psychological parable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>two women</strong> represent competing inner states—truth and fear, love and jealousy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>child</strong> is the imagined desire, the manifestation sought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>sword</strong> symbolizes the creative decision, the power to separate reality from illusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One woman’s willingness to see the child divided reveals a state of fear and control, the other’s plea to spare the child reveals true love and surrender. Solomon’s wise judgment is not a legal trick but an expression of <strong>the feeling of assumed wisdom</strong>—calm, assured, and rooted in knowing.</p>
<h3>Solomon’s Feeling: The Stillness of Assumed Wisdom</h3>
<p>Solomon’s feeling throughout the judgment is crucial. Neville teaches that <strong>feeling is the secret</strong> to manifestation. The king is not confused or uncertain; he acts from a place of stillness and deep inner conviction. His suggestion is designed to expose the true nature of each claimant, relying on feeling rather than external proof.</p>
<p>This illustrates the Law of Assumption: when you live and act from the feeling of your wish fulfilled, your imagination sorts truth from falsehood, and reality rearranges accordingly.</p>
<h3>All Israel Feared the King (1 Kings 3:28)</h3>
<p>The chapter closes by saying Israel revered Solomon because they saw that the wisdom of God was in him. This is the world reflecting your inner state. When you assume a state of wisdom, discernment, and love, your external circumstances align as if by divine design.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion: Walking as Solomon</strong></p>
<p>Solomon is not merely a historical king but a symbol of the consciousness that governs life through assumption, discernment, and unwavering inner wisdom. You become Solomon every time you stop looking outward for proof and instead rest in the knowing of your fulfilled desire.</p>
<p>The promise stands true: <em>“Because thou hast asked this thing…”</em> When you seek to embody understanding and assume the state of wisdom, abundance flows—not as a reward, but as a natural reflection of your inner world.</p>
