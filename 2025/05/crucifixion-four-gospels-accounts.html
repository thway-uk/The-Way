<h1>Crucifixion: Four Gospels Accounts</h1>
<p>The crucifixion of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> stands as one of the most profound and transformative symbols in the Bible. Traditionally viewed through the lens of sacrifice and redemption, this event, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s framework of assumption, unveils a deeper spiritual concept: the creative power of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a> and the process of manifesting dconcept</p><p>Neville teaches that the secret to manifesting anything lies in assuming the feeling of the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">wish fulfilled—living as though the desired state already exists within you.</a> In this article, we explore how each of the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—depicts the crucifixion of Jesus and how these depictions align with Neville’s principle of assumption. We also draw connections to the <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">forefathers of manifestation in the Bible—Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah</a>—whose lives embody the qualities of faith, persistence, imagination, and praise. These figures reveal that the principle of assumption is not a modern novelty but an ancient spiritual law embedded throughout scripture.</p><p>The New Testament, as the fulfilment of the Old, completes the themes and symbols first introduced in the Hebrew scriptures. The crucifixion, as a pivotal moment, serves as the culmination of all that was foreshadowed in the stories of Abraham’s unwavering faith, Jacob’s transformative persistence, Joseph’s imaginative vision, and Judah’s praise. It reveals the inner spiritual journey and shows us how we can transform our consciousness by embracing these eternal principles.</p><hr /><h2>Matthew: The Fulfilment of Prophecy and the Assurance of Assumption</h2><p>In <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Matthew’s Gospel</a>, the crucifixion is presented as the fulfilment of ancient prophecies. Jesus’s suffering and death are not portrayed as tragic accidents but as essential acts that complete a divine narrative. This approach illuminates the law of assumption: the unfolding of events according to an inner conviction held with unwavering faith.</p><p>Matthew portrays Jesus as entirely conscious of his role, moving through his final hours with the awareness that he is fulfilling what has already been assumed in spirit. This mirrors the act of assuming a state so fully that external reality cannot help but conform. When we, like Abraham, hold fast to the unseen promise—believing in the fatherhood he was promised despite all physical evidence—we enact the same principle. The crucifixion in Matthew thus represents the conscious fulfilment of one’s assumed state, regardless of external appearances.</p><hr /><h2>Mark: The Divine Drama of Death and Resurrection</h2><p><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Mark’s</a> account emphasises the raw emotional and physical intensity of Jesus’s experience. The darkness, the cry of abandonment, and the tearing of the temple veil all point to the intense inner struggles faced when dissolving old identities.</p><p>The tearing of the veil is central to Neville’s teachings. It symbolises the collapse of the old self, the final rupture of limiting beliefs, and the unveiling of the inner sanctuary of imagination. To assume a new state, one must undergo this inner crisis: the discomfort of leaving behind a known identity and the fear that accompanies stepping into a new possibility.</p><p>This dynamic is embodied in Jacob’s night-long struggle with the angel. Jacob refused to let go until he received his blessing, signifying the unwavering persistence needed to hold an assumption against all opposition. Mark’s portrayal of the crucifixion as a moment of profound breaking apart aligns perfectly with the necessity of inner transformation: old forms must dissolve to give way to new life.</p><hr /><h2>Luke: The Emphasis on Forgiveness and the Active State of Being</h2><p><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Luke’s</a> Gospel reveals Jesus’s compassion and forgiveness even in his final moments: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” This forgiveness is not merely moral; it is deeply practical in the process of assumption.</p><p>Neville teaches that one cannot assume a new state while holding onto resentment or guilt. The act of forgiveness clears the inner field, making way for new states to be fully embodied. Jesus’s forgiveness from the cross is the ultimate expression of inner release—the dissolution of all inner conflicts that might obstruct the birth of a new self.</p><p>Joseph’s story in Genesis is a living example of this principle. Betrayed and imprisoned, Joseph forgives his brothers and, through this act, steps into the fullness of his dream. His imagination, untouched by bitterness, brings him into his highest expression. Joseph shows us that forgiveness is the door through which our assumptions enter reality.</p><hr /><h2>John: The Finality of the Word Made Flesh</h2><p><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">John’s</a> Gospel presents the crucifixion as the final act of completion: “It is finished.” These words signify the moment when an assumed state is so fully accepted that it becomes an irreversible inner reality.</p><p>Neville highlights the importance of this finality. When you truly accept a state as done, no further effort is needed. The outer world must reflect it because consciousness alone creates reality. In John, Jesus’s calm declaration embodies this principle: once the assumption is fully fixed, the manifestation is inevitable.</p><p>This moment echoes Judah’s role as the one who praises. Praise, in Neville’s teachings, is not mere verbal gratitude; it is the energetic confirmation that the desire is already complete. Judah’s name means “praise,” and he symbolises the act of rejoicing in the fulfilment before its physical appearance. In this light, “It is finished” and praise are one and the same: a final, confident acknowledgment that the creation is complete.</p><hr /><h2>The Crucifixion and the Fixation of Assumption</h2><p>The word "crucifixion" derives from Latin crucifixio, meaning “fixed” or “fastened.” In Neville’s teaching, this fixing is crucial. The cross is not merely an instrument of physical death but a symbol of fixing an assumption so firmly in the mind that it becomes the core of one’s identity.</p><p>The place of crucifixion—Golgotha, meaning "the place of the skull"—points directly to the mind as the true site of transformation. It is within the skull that assumptions are fixed, and it is from this inner crucifixion that new realities arise.</p><p>This internal fixing signifies that once a state is adopted and fully embodied, it cannot be undone. The external world will inevitably conform to the inner image. The crucifixion, then, symbolises the ultimate act of creative assumption: the complete commitment to a chosen state, regardless of appearances or external resistance.</p><hr /><h2>Conclusion: The Common Thread of Assumption</h2><p>Seen through Neville Goddard’s teachings, the crucifixion across the four Gospels offers a rich map for the process of manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew</strong> shows us prophecy’s fulfilment, encouraging unwavering faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark</strong> highlights the necessary dissolution of old beliefs and the power of persistence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke</strong> teaches the crucial role of forgiveness in embodying a new state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John</strong> celebrates the finality of the word made flesh—the completed assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These narratives are not merely historical accounts but living symbols of how we can transform consciousness and shape reality. The forefathers—Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Judah—demonstrated these qualities long before Jesus’s story, showing us that the law of assumption is woven throughout all scripture.</p><p>The crucifixion ultimately stands as a timeless invitation: to fix our desired state within, to live as though it were already so, and to know that through this inner act, the outer world must inevitably follow. Once the assumption is nailed in consciousness, “It is finished,” and manifestation becomes not a matter of if, but when.</p>
