<h1>The Valley of Dry Bones:  The Creation of Woman and Life</h1>
<p>The Bible, when stripped of literalism, becomes the diary of consciousness—an intimate charting of the inner man’s rise from fragmentation to fullness. Neville Goddard taught that every character, valley, and breath in scripture is symbolic of a spiritual process happening within you.</p><p>Ezekiel 37:1-14, often read as a vision of national restoration, is in truth a vivid allegory of personal resurrection—the reanimation of a lost or abandoned state of being through the power of imagination. When paired with Genesis 2:23 and Adam's statement regarding the creation of woman—<em>“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh”</em>—we see not two isolated scriptures, but a single unfolding: the act of reclaiming and recognising the manifestation as coming from within oneself.</p><p>This article walks through Ezekiel’s vision step by step, aligned with Neville’s principle that imagination is the only creative power. The bones are not strangers. They are fragments of you. And when you speak life over them, what returns is not foreign—but familiar. Flesh of your flesh. The imagined become real.</p><hr /><h3><strong>1. “The hand of the Lord was upon me…” – The Initiation of Vision</strong></h3><p>Ezekiel is carried in the spirit to a valley full of bones. Neville would say this isn’t a location in space but in consciousness. The “hand of the Lord” is <strong>awareness being stirred</strong>—the moment when you are made to face your inner barrenness. The dry bones represent <strong>dead states</strong>, long-forgotten desires, past versions of self that have lost vitality.</p><p>In this valley, you see not an enemy, but the <strong>fragments of self</strong>. Bones are what remain after all else is stripped away—<strong>the essence of what once was alive in you</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>2. “Can these bones live?” – The Divine Challenge to Imagination</strong></h3><p>God asks Ezekiel, <em>“Can these bones live?”</em> Neville would say this is the eternal question posed to the human imagination. Can the state you’ve abandoned—be it confidence, love, joy, health—be revived through assumption?</p><p>The prophet doesn’t answer definitively; he replies, <em>“O Lord God, thou knowest.”</em> This isn’t doubt, but a handover. It’s a recognition that it is <strong>not by effort</strong>, but by alignment with the creative power of consciousness—by speaking the word, not by analysing the problem.</p><hr /><h3><strong>3. “Prophesy upon these bones…” – Imagination Takes Command</strong></h3><p>Now the real work begins. Ezekiel is told to <strong>speak to the bones</strong>, to tell them to hear the word of the Lord. Neville always emphasised that <strong>creation begins with an assumption spoken within</strong>. The word isn’t just speech—it is the <em>felt assumption</em> that the state is alive.</p><p>The act of prophesying here is not fortune-telling; it is <strong>commanding life</strong> into a condition that has none. This is the moment when you dare to speak to the thing you’ve buried and <strong>assume its return</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>4. “Bone came together to his bone…” – Inner Structure Returns</strong></h3><p>As the prophet speaks, there’s a noise, a shaking—<strong>movement in consciousness</strong>. Things that seemed scattered and disconnected begin to assemble. This is not yet the full manifestation, but the moment where your inner world <strong>starts to reorient</strong> toward the new identity.</p><p>The phrase <em>“bone to his bone”</em> echoes <strong>Genesis 2:23</strong>: <em>“bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.”</em> In Neville’s language, this is recognition. You begin to feel the <em>rightness</em> of the state. The image you’ve imagined starts to feel familiar, intimate, even though it has not yet appeared in your outer world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>5. “But there was no breath in them…” – The Lifelike Yet Lifeless Phase</strong></h3><p>Though the bones are now structured with sinews and flesh, they remain inert. This symbolises the state that has been fully imagined but not yet <strong>felt as real</strong>. Neville often said that many imagine things vividly but fail to <strong>breathe life into them</strong> through belief and emotion.</p><p>This is the danger of living only in visualisation without inhabiting the state emotionally. The body is there—but <strong>breath</strong>, which Neville equates with the <strong>life-giving intensity of assumption</strong>, has not yet entered.</p><hr /><h3><strong>6. “Prophesy unto the wind…” – Calling the Breath: Emotional Investment</strong></h3><p>Now Ezekiel is told to call to the breath—to the <strong>ruach</strong>, the spirit. This is not just imagery; it is Neville’s act of <strong>feeling the state inwardly until it is alive</strong>. The breath is <strong>emotional conviction</strong>. It’s the power of <em>I AM</em> infused with desire and belief.</p><p>As Neville taught, once you feel the state as real, you’ve breathed life into it. You no longer think <em>“I wish,”</em> but <em>“I am.”</em> That’s when the state <strong>stands on its feet</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>7. “An exceeding great army…” – The Embodied Identity Emerges</strong></h3><p>The bones become a vast army—no longer fragments, but <strong>an empowered collective identity</strong>. The state is no longer a vague dream or private hope; it is something you <strong>stand in</strong>, walk in, and carry in your awareness.</p><p>This is the resurrection of a new version of you. Not simply a return to life, but an <strong>elevated, unified state</strong>—strengthened by the very death it overcame.</p><hr /><h3><strong>8. “These bones are the whole house of Israel…” – The Spiritual Realisation</strong></h3><p>Finally, God says: <em>“These bones are the whole house of Israel… they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost.”</em> This is the mindset many live in—thinking the state is too far gone, the desire too unrealistic.</p><p>But God responds: <em>“I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live.”</em> Neville saw “Israel” as a symbol of <strong>spiritual awakening</strong>—the process by which man discovers himself to be God-in-man, the creator of his reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>9. The Genesis 2:23 Moment – Recognition of the Created as Self</strong></h3><p>Once the bones are alive and standing, Ezekiel does not shrink back in awe of some foreign miracle. Just as Adam looks at Eve and says <em>“This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,”</em> so does the imaginer look at the manifestation and recognise it as <strong>an emanation of their own assumption</strong>.</p><p>It is <em>yours</em> not because you earned it or attracted it, but because <strong>you were its source</strong>. It was taken from you, formed through you, and is now returned to walk beside you as part of your world.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Return of the Recognisable State</strong></h3><p>Ezekiel’s vision is not a prophecy for a future nation—it is a roadmap for how a person <strong>resurrects their inner world</strong>. And Genesis 2:23 gives the emotional punctuation: the moment you see your world and say, <em>“This is mine. This is me. This came from within.”</em></p><p>Neville Goddard taught that you are both the prophet and the Adam. You imagine. You assume. You prophesy. And then you behold your creation—not as a miracle from above, but as <strong>bone of your bones and flesh of your flesh</strong>.</p>
