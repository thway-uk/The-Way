<h1>Shimei: The Self-Deprecating Voice That Always Seems to Haunt Us</h1>
<p><em>Interpreting a Troubling Biblical Figure through Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</em></p><p>In the biblical narrative, few characters appear so fleetingly yet with such emotional force as <strong>Shimei</strong>—the Benjamite who curses David during his lowest moment. At first glance, Shimei seems little more than a spiteful heckler. But through the interpretive framework of Neville Goddard’s <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, we uncover a deeper truth: Shimei is not just a man on a hill throwing stones—he is a mirror of the inner world.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Story of Shimei: A Quick Recap</strong></h2><p>Shimei first appears in <strong>2 Samuel 16:5–13</strong>, where he hurls stones and insults at King David as he flees from his son Absalom. He accuses David of bloodshed and usurpation, claiming that David is now receiving what he deserves. David, rather than reacting in fury, restrains his men from harming Shimei, even suggesting that his cursing may be from the Lord.</p><p>Here is the passage from the Bible that captures this moment:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Samuel 16:5-13 (NIV)</strong></p>
<p><em>As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul’s family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out.</em><br />
<em>“Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel!” he said.</em><br />
<em>“The Lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a murderer!”</em><br />
<em>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.”</em><br />
<em>But the king said, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why do you do this?’”</em><br />
<em>David then said to Abishai and all his officials, “My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. It may be that the Lord will look upon my misery and restore to me his covenant blessing instead of his curse today.”</em><br />
<em>So David and his men continued along the road, while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him.</em><br />
<em>(2 Samuel 16:5-13, NIV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>David’s restraint here offers a profound lesson: rather than reacting with anger, he <strong>acknowledges</strong> the curse without internalising it. This moment shows us how <strong>negative beliefs and accusations</strong>—no matter how strong—can be observed without allowing them to dominate our lives.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Shimei’s Name: The Voice You Choose to Hear</strong></h2><p>The name “Shimei” comes from the Hebrew root <em>shama</em> (שָׁמַע), meaning “to hear” or “to listen.” This is a crucial detail in understanding Shimei’s role. While he is throwing stones and cursing David, he is also symbolising the <strong>voice</strong> that you <strong>choose to listen to</strong> during moments of personal transformation. Shimei’s voice isn’t just about outward accusations—it reflects the <strong>inner dialogue</strong> that seeks attention and often arises when we are moving away from old patterns of thought.</p><p>This insight connects directly to Neville Goddard’s <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, which teaches that what we <strong>listen to</strong> (or what we <strong>allow into our consciousness</strong>) shapes our reality. When we persist in the assumption of our desires, we must be mindful of what we <strong>hear</strong> or allow ourselves to internalise, as it influences the world we create.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Shimei as a Symbol: Neville Goddard's Lens</strong></h2><p>According to Neville Goddard, “<strong>All that you behold, though it appears without, it is within, in your imagination.</strong>” The world, he taught, is a projection of our internal assumptions and states.</p><p>Goddard also emphasised that <strong>consciousness creates reality</strong>. In his framework, when we persist in certain assumptions—whether empowering or limiting—those assumptions become externalised in the world around us.</p><h3><strong>Shimei: The Inner Self-Critic or Self-Condemnation</strong></h3><p>Shimei’s accusations can be interpreted as the self-critical or self-deprecating thoughts that many people have when they are going through transitions, personal growth, or even manifesting new desires. These thoughts are often rooted in <strong>guilt, fear, or self-doubt</strong>, much like the accusations Shimei directs at David. Neville might describe Shimei’s role as symbolic of the <strong>negative assumptions</strong> or limiting beliefs that people carry with them about themselves. For example, when a person begins to change their state of consciousness (as David did by becoming king), their old, limiting beliefs (represented by Shimei) might resurface.</p><hr /><h3><strong>David’s Restraint: Acknowledging Negative Thoughts</strong></h3><p>When David refrains from silencing Shimei immediately, it reflects an understanding that negative thoughts or beliefs may arise during moments of personal transformation, but they <strong>do not define the new reality</strong> being created. Rather than reacting impulsively to the inner critic, David’s restraint can be seen as a conscious choice to <strong>acknowledge</strong> these negative assumptions without giving them power. This mirrors Neville’s teaching that, rather than suppressing or fighting against negative thoughts, one must <strong>recognise them</strong> and shift the assumption they are based on.</p><p>However, Neville would emphasise that, while acknowledging these negative thoughts, it is essential to <strong>proactively</strong> create the new assumption. David’s restraint is important, but <strong>actively shifting to the new assumption</strong> is what truly changes the course of events. Neville teaches that simply enduring old negative thoughts is not enough; one must consciously take on a <strong>new belief or assumption</strong> about oneself to see lasting change.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Solomon’s Role: A New Assumption Must Be Protected</strong></h3><p>When Solomon takes over, David’s parting advice is essentially: don’t let Shimei go unchecked. Solomon, as a new king and a new state of consciousness, sets a clear boundary. If Shimei—this personification of self-condemnation—breaks the rule, he must be removed.</p><p>This final act is not about vengeance, but <strong>spiritual hygiene</strong>. A new assumption must protect itself from old patterns. In the world of imagination, we cannot persist in the old belief (“I don’t deserve this,” “I am guilty,” etc.) and expect a new reality to stabilise.</p><p>Shimei leaving Jerusalem is like the resurgence of a limiting belief sneaking back into consciousness. And the result? That belief is put to death. Neville’s teaching would focus on <strong>actively replacing</strong> these old beliefs with new, empowering assumptions, rather than simply letting the old ones linger or passively tolerating them.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Deeper Message</strong></h2><p>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption teaches that what you persist in assuming—about yourself, about life—will harden into fact. Shimei represents those lingering mental voices that challenge your new assumption. When you affirm “I am successful,” “I am worthy,” or “I am loved,” Shimei appears as the whisper: “No you’re not.”</p><p>The lesson? <strong>Don’t suppress the voice by force—understand it, acknowledge it, and then proactively replace it with a new assumption.</strong> David spares him, but Solomon—representing the firm establishment of a new identity—must deal with him decisively.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2><p>In your own inner world, <strong>Shimei is the thought that accuses</strong>—but it only holds power if you believe it. Let Solomon—the wisdom of your new state—stand firm. Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled. Let the past stay buried. Let Shimei stay within the city walls—or let him be gone.</p><p>This is where Neville’s teachings shine: <strong>Create and persist in the assumption of your new reality</strong>. Let go of the past assumptions, and let them die as Shimei did. In this way, the new, empowered version of yourself will take root and flourish.</p>
