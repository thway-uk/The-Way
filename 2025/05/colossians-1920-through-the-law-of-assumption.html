<h1>Colossians 1:9–20 Through the Law of Assumption</h1>
<p><em>Rediscovering the Inner Christ as the Creative Power of Consciousness</em></p>
<p>Colossians 1:9–20 is often read as a celebration of a historical Christ, but through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teaching, it takes on a profoundly personal and transformational meaning. Here, the “Christ” is not a man outside of you—it is <strong>your own imagination</strong>, your I AMness, the only true creative power.</p>
<p>Let us walk through these verses with the awareness that the Bible is a psychological drama, not a secular history book. The characters and claims are symbolic of your own <strong>inner process of awakening</strong>, and the Law of Assumption reveals the method by which this awakening occurs.</p>

<h2><strong>Verses 9–12: Live From the End</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not cease to pray for you… that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Paul expresses his desire that the listener be filled with spiritual understanding. Neville Goddard would say this is nothing other than <strong>the understanding of how imagination works</strong>. The “will of God” is not something imposed from above. It is <strong>your deepest desire</strong>—the one that keeps nudging you, asking you to believe in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“That you may walk worthy… being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To “walk worthy” of the Lord is to <strong>live from the end</strong>—to mentally and emotionally occupy the state of already having your desire. Fruitfulness naturally follows, because your outer world always reflects your inner assumptions. To increase in the knowledge of God is to <strong>see yourself as God sees you</strong>: already complete, already whole, already what you desire to be.</p>

<h2><strong>Verses 13–14: Delivered From the State of Lack</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption… the forgiveness of sins.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Darkness” symbolises <strong>the state of ignorance</strong>—where we live according to appearances, feel separated from what we want, and forget that we are the operant power. “Delivered from darkness” means <strong>becoming aware of your ability to assume the state desired</strong>, and in doing so, shifting your reality.</p>
<p>You are “redeemed” the moment you <strong>forgive yourself</strong> for living in a lesser state—meaning, you stop identifying with it—and rise into a new assumption. “Sin,” as Neville defines it, is <strong>missing the mark</strong>, and forgiveness is simply the realignment with the truth that <strong>I AM is God</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>Verses 15–17: Imagination as the First Cause</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created… visible and invisible… all things were created through Him and for Him.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses beautifully affirm the <strong>primacy of imagination</strong>. The “image of the invisible God” is the human imagination, which gives form to what is otherwise unseen. All things—both physical and mental—are birthed first in the unseen realm of consciousness.</p>
<p>What you assume to be true in your imagination, whether deliberately or by habit, becomes your world. You are the “firstborn” when you awaken to this truth—that <strong>nothing is created outside the self</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagination precedes experience. It is the <em>sustainer</em> of reality. If you assume lack, the world will continue to reflect it. But once you shift your assumption, the outer world must reorganise itself. All things “hold together” by the inner state you persist in.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Verse 18: The Head of the Body</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He is the head of the body, the church… the beginning, the firstborn from the dead…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “body” represents your world, and “Christ” is your awakened imagination—the <strong>director of your experience</strong>. To be “firstborn from the dead” is to rise from the grave of unawareness, from the belief that you are limited or at the mercy of external events.</p>
<p>The church, then, is <strong>your own consciousness</strong>, and Christ is the governing principle within it: <strong>I AM</strong>. You are the beginning of every creation, because <strong>without your assumption, nothing takes form.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Verses 19–20: Reconciliation and Peace Through Assumption</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fullness of God—creativity, wholeness, wisdom, and love—dwells in <strong>your imagination</strong>. There is nothing outside of it. Once you accept this, you no longer search for help from outside; you turn within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And by Him to reconcile all things to Himself… having made peace through the blood of His cross.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the most profound revelations in the passage. To “reconcile all things” is to <strong>bring every condition of your world into alignment with your inner vision</strong>. Reconciliation is not external negotiation; it is inner assumption.</p>
<p>The “blood” symbolises <strong>life given to a belief</strong>, and the “cross” is the moment you <em>die to what you were and live in what you now claim to be</em>. You “carry your cross” when you remain faithful to your desired state, even when your senses mock it. Peace comes not from striving, but from <strong>resting in the knowing</strong> that what you have assumed is already yours.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Closing Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Colossians 1:9–20, seen through the Law of Assumption, becomes a guide for <strong>inner transformation</strong>. It teaches that all change begins within. Christ is not a man external to you, but <strong>your own imagination</strong>—the creative centre of your world.</p>
<p>You are redeemed the moment you assume a new state. You are raised from the dead each time you let go of the old man and live from your ideal. And you are reconciled when you bring your outer world into harmony with your inner knowing.</p>
<p>Let this be your gospel:<br />
<strong>"As within, so without. As I assume, so it shall be."</strong></p>
