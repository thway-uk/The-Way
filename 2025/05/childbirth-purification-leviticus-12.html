<h1>Childbirth Purification: Leviticus 12</h1>
<p>Leviticus 12 is traditionally read as a prescription for ritual purification after childbirth. And in a way, it is a ritualistic and crude attempt at <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">cleaving</a> before Jesus' embodiment.  When interpreted symbolically, as Neville Goddard teaches, it reveals a process: the purification that follows the birth of a new state of consciousness. It is not about literal childbirth, but the inner <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">unfolding of assumption</a>—the shedding of the old self and the emergence of a new identity.</p>
<p>In Neville’s symbolic framework, every child—male or female—represents a state of being. A male <b><i>child</i></b> is the conscious aspect of the <b><i>newly assumed ideal</i></b>; a female child is the subconscious aspect of the same state. There is a doubling. The “mother,” or former state of mind, becomes “<b><i>unclean</i></b>” not in any moral sense, but because it is now <b><i>out of alignment</i></b>, and cannot be "touched". Once the new state is conceived, the former way of thinking can no longer access or sustain it. Thus begins the necessary process of purging and integration—the cleansing of both conscious and subconscious forms.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:2: "If a woman have conceived seed..."</strong></blockquote>
This marks the beginning of an assumption taking form. The “woman” here is the subconscious—receptive, fertile, always impressionable. To “conceive seed” is to impress a new belief or self-concept upon the subconscious mind.<p></p>
<p>Neville often likened the subconscious to a woman: once a seed (belief) is planted, it grows inevitably into form. Creation has begun.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"...and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days"</strong></blockquote>
The man-child is the outward expression of the newly assumed self—the ideal made visible. The mother (previous state of mind) is declared unclean for seven days, symbolising a complete phase of transformation. Seven is the biblical number of completion, echoing the seven days of creation.<p></p>
<p>This separation is necessary: you cannot return to the old mindset once the new has been conceived. To remain double-minded would split the creative power. The new belief must now rule alone.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:3: "And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised"</strong></blockquote>
The eighth day represents resurrection, a new beginning. Circumcision symbolises the cutting away of doubt, memory, and identification with the old self. It is the removal of all that contradicts the assumption.<p></p>
<p>This is Neville’s crucifixion symbol—the assumption is fixed in the mind, nailed there until it becomes reality. Nothing extraneous remains. Only pure belief.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:4: "She shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days..."</strong></blockquote>
Thirty-three is the number of promise fulfilled. Jesus lived 33 years, marking the full maturation of the divine state before its expression through resurrection. Here, 33 days represent the period of spiritual alignment during which the new identity is nourished and confirmed, and formed in both the inner and outer worlds.<p></p>
<p>In Neville’s framework, the number three represents a complete movement: from idea (1), to gestation (2), to manifestation (3). The doubling of three—as seen in 6, 33, or even 66—deepens the symbolism. It signals reinforcement, confirmation, and the perfected repetition of the assumption. As with Pharaoh’s dreams or Joseph’s double visions, repetition affirms truth.</p>
<p>This “blood of purifying” is not physical—it’s symbolic of the emotional and energetic effort to cleanse the inner life force from former beliefs. That force must now be redirected to nourish the new assumption, and petition here seems to be focused on as the force of gestation and birth into the outer world.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:5: "If she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks..."</strong></blockquote>
A female child symbolises the subconscious vessel of the newly born state—its inner, receptive form. The unclean period is doubled to 14 days, highlighting the greater complexity of integrating two spiritual states on the subconscious level.<p></p>
<p>This doubling reflects deeper purification, the inner work required when transforming beliefs stored beneath conscious awareness. Just as Leah and Rachel or Hagar and Sarah represent competing states of consciousness, the old and new subconscious conditions must now be sorted and reconciled.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>"...and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days"</strong></blockquote>
The process of testing continues—66 days representing sustained purification and reinforcement.<p></p>
<p>Again, we see the doubling: 33 + 33. The repetition strengthens the manifestation. Joseph’s double dreams illustrate this same principle—the assumption must be confirmed inwardly before it becomes outward fact.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:6: "And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled... she shall bring a lamb..."</strong></blockquote>
Once the process of purifying—of mental and emotional realignment—is complete, a symbolic offering is made. The lamb represents innocence, surrender, and the committed embrace of the new state of being.<p></p>
<p>To “bring a lamb” is to give oneself wholly to the assumption, without doubt or turning back. The offering is not to appease, but to affirm: “This is now who I am.”</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:7: "Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her..."</strong></blockquote>
The priest here symbolises the mediating power of awareness, which unites the new state (the lamb) with the Divine Law. To “make atonement” is not to seek forgiveness, but to bring everything into alignment with the assumption.<p></p>
<p>Atonement—at-one-ment—is the moment the inner and outer match. The offering is accepted, not because it pleases a distant God, but because the assumption has been faithfully honoured and fixed in consciousness. This is the spiritual completion of birth.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>Leviticus 12:8: "And if she be not able to bring a lamb... then two turtledoves..."</strong></blockquote>
Even if one cannot bring the ideal form (the lamb), the law makes room for symbolic substitutes. Two turtledoves or pigeons represent the dual aspects of self: conscious and subconscious, intellect and feeling. The offering may be modest, but the structure remains.<p></p>
<p>What matters is not the grandeur of the ritual, but the sincerity of the inner shift. The two birds still affirm the union of conscious intent and subconscious acceptance. Nothing is wasted. Every movement of belief, however small, is sacred.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion: The Law in Leviticus Is the Law of Assumption</strong><br />
Leviticus—the book of the priesthood—is not about external rituals, but about the internal workings of manifestation. The name Levi means to join, and here we witness the sacred union between conscious direction and subconscious receptivity.</p>
<p>Even the numbers reinforce the process: six (represented in Hebrew by <em>Vav</em>, meaning “nail”) symbolises the fixing of the assumption in mind. Circumcision, blood, and time are not punishments, but tools. They serve to cut away the old self, purify the creative force, and confirm the new identity until it becomes dominant.</p>
<p>This is not about legalism—it is about law. The Law of Assumption: imagining, believing, and living from the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
