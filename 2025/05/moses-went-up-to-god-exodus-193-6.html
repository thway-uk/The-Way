<h1>Moses Went Up to God: Exodus 19:3-6</h1>
<p>When the <a href="/2025/04/israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">children of Israel</a> — symbolising new awareness born from a change in self-identity — reach Mount Sinai, something unfolds. This is not a historical covenant but a psychological one for the elevation into imaginative awareness, as Neville Goddard taught.</p><p>Through Exodus 19:3–6, we see the movement from bondage to breakthrough within consciousness — the shift from outer dependence to inner realisation of “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>.”</p><hr /><h3>Exodus 19:3 — “Moses went up to God”</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And Moses went up to God, and the Lord said to him from the mountain, Say to the children of Jacob and to the children of Israel:”<br />
Exodus 19:3</p>
</blockquote><p>In symbolism, Moses represents your developed ability to hear the inner voice — to commune with the “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>” (Exodus 3:14). The mountain is the high place of consciousness; the eagle symbolises the vision and flight of imagination.</p><p>When Moses ascends the mountain, it reflects your own act of turning away from the senses and lifting your attention to a higher state — where you hear true inner guidance.</p><hr /><h3>Exodus 19:4 — “I took you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself”</h3><blockquote>
<p>“You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I took you on eagles’ wings and made you come to myself.”<br />
Exodus 19:4</p>
</blockquote><p>This verse is spoken in the past tense — affirming that deliverance has already taken place. Egypt symbolises mental bondage and limitation. The eagle’s wings represent effortless spiritual elevation, showing how imagination lifts you when you surrender to your true nature.</p><p>The phrase <em>“brought you to myself”</em> is vital: it reveals that the destination is not a location but a state — your own being, the “I AM.” This echoes Jesus’ words: <em>“<a href="/2025/05/in-my-fathers-house-john-142-3.html">In my Father’s house are many resting-places</a>”</em> (John 14:2). All true deliverance is a return to self-realisation.</p><hr /><h3>Exodus 19:5 — “If you will truly give ear to my voice... you will be my special treasure”</h3><blockquote>
<p>“If you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement, then you will be my special property out of all the peoples: for all the earth is mine.”<br />
Exodus 19:5</p>
</blockquote><p>Here we see the condition: obey the inner voice. In Neville’s teaching, this means remaining loyal to your assumption — to your inner vision — rather than to outer facts.</p><p>To be a “special property” or “peculiar treasure” means to be precious and set apart. The soul that obeys the I AM lives as through self-authorship rather than to reaction and limitation.</p><hr /><h3>Exodus 19:6 — “You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation”</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel.”<br />
Exodus 19:6</p>
</blockquote><p>A kingdom of priests symbolises individuals who know how to minister from within — who offer the true sacrifice of self, letting go of the old identity to embody a chosen new state.</p><p>A “holy nation” is not a physical territory but a collective of inner states aligned with the creative power of the I AM (Exodus 3:14). It is a nation born not of geography but of awareness.</p>
