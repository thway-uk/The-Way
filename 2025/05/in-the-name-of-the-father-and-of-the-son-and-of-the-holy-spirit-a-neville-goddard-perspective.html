<h1>"In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit": A Neville Goddard Perspective</h1>
<p>The familiar phrase:</p><blockquote>
<p><i>"</i>...<b style="font-style: italic;">in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</b><i>.". - Matthew 28:19</i></p>
</blockquote><p>is traditionally used in Christian prayers and liturgical practices. However, when viewed through the teachings of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, it takes on an entirely new dimension. Rather than a call to external ritual, it becomes an invitation to <strong>assume</strong>—to recognise and embody the divine trinity within your own consciousness.</p><hr /><h3><strong>"In the Name": Assumption of Essence</strong></h3><p>For Neville, the <strong>"name"</strong> means far more than a title. It represents the <strong>nature</strong>, <strong>essence</strong>, or <strong>power</strong> of something. To act <em>in the name of</em> is to <strong>assume and express</strong> the qualities associated with that being.</p><blockquote>
<p>To do something “in the name of” is to do it <strong>in the character</strong> and <strong>nature</strong> of that state.</p>
</blockquote><p>So, before we even get to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, we are being instructed to <strong>enter into the nature</strong> of each.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Father: Awareness of Being</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s framework, <strong>the Father</strong> symbolises your <strong>own awareness of being</strong>—the “I AM” at the centre of all experience.</p><p>This is the <strong>origin</strong> of everything in your world. To act in the name of the Father is to operate from the <strong>conscious knowing</strong> that <strong>you are the source</strong> of what you perceive.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Father = unconditioned awareness</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>uncaused cause</strong> from which all things arise</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>The Son: Fulfilled Desire</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Son</strong> is your <strong>desire realised</strong>. Just as a son is the visible expression of his father, your world is the expression of your <strong>assumed state</strong>.</p><p>To act in the name of the Son is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Live from the end</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel as though your wish has already been fulfilled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let your world reflect the <strong>image</strong> you hold within</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Son is the form your awareness takes when clothed in desire.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Holy Spirit: Imagination in Motion</strong></h3><p>The Holy Spirit is the power that bridges awareness (the Father) and form (the Son), making them one—<em>whole</em>. For Neville, this is none other than your <strong>imagination</strong>, specifically imagination <strong>infused with feeling</strong>.</p><p>To act in the name of the Holy Spirit is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>imaginative feeling</strong> deliberately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animate your assumptions with emotion and persistence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust the unseen movement from assumption to reality</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the divine action that brings what’s within into view.</p><hr /><h3><strong>A Living Formula for Creation</strong></h3><p>Through the Law of Assumption, this passage becomes a <strong>practical formula</strong> for manifestation:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Father</strong> – your awareness of being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Son</strong> – your assumed, fulfilled desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong> – the imaginative power that brings it forth</p>
</li>
</ol><p>When you <strong>baptise</strong> yourself in these three—<strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>assumption</strong>, and <strong>imaginative feeling</strong>—you are not performing an outer rite but an <strong>inner transformation</strong>. You are immersing yourself in the truth that <strong>you are the operant power</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Trinity Within</strong></h3><p>No longer an external invocation, <em>"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"</em> becomes a profound affirmation of your creative self.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You are the Father</strong>, aware of being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are the Son</strong>, clothed in fulfilled desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are the Holy Spirit</strong>, animating reality through imagination</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the sacred trinity—<strong>not distant, but indwelling</strong>. A divine pattern hidden in plain sight, awaiting only your assumption.</p>
