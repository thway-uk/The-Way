But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the army with the oath; he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into a honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. - 1 Samuel 14:27</blockquote><p></p><p>This simple act—breaking a command—might seem like a mistake on the surface. Yet symbolically, it represents a profound moment: Jonathan’s consciousness, though unintentional, connects with the <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">rich sweetness of assuming the fulfilled desire</a></strong>. His “enlightened eyes” signal an awakening—a shift in his inner state brought about by the <strong>experience of tasting what has already been won</strong>.</p>
<p>This episode shows how even an accidental alignment with the <strong><a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">feeling of accomplishment</a></strong> can illuminate and transform one’s awareness, demonstrating the power of the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> in effect. It’s a reminder that manifestation is often sparked by the subtle, felt experience of “living in the end,” even before the external evidence appears.</p>

<h3>Honey as the Symbol of the Feeling of Accomplishment</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teaching, honey represents the <strong>sweetness and richness of imagination realised</strong>—the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Jonathan’s “rod” can be seen as his personal will or intent, and the honeycomb represents the imagined state tasted and assumed as real.</p>
<p>When Jonathan tastes the honey, he embodies the <strong>law of accomplishment</strong>—he assumes the feeling of having already achieved his desire. His “<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">enlightened eyes</a>” signify the shift in consciousness caused by <strong>living in the end</strong>.</p>
<p>Though outwardly breaking a human rule, Jonathan’s inner state aligns with the <strong>law of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a></strong>: the creative power of feeling as if the desired end is already fulfilled. This alignment shifts his consciousness, bringing about the experience of illumination.</p>

<h3>Song of Solomon: The Feeling of Living in the End Expressed Through Honey</h3>
<p>The <em>Song of Solomon</em> is rich with honey imagery: “Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue” (Song of Solomon 4:11). And later, “I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey” (5:1).</p>
<p>This language is not just romantic poetry. It symbolises the <strong>felt experience of <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">accomplished desire</a></strong>—the state Neville Goddard calls “living in the end.” The sweetness of honey dripping from the lips and hidden under the tongue represents the <strong>inner reality of fulfilled wishes</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>Song of Solomon</em> poetically captures the vital feeling that imagination is not just fantasy but the experiential state that creates reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Garden of Eden and Song of Solomon: Recurring Symbols of Imagination’s Power</h3>
<p>The imagery of the <strong>Garden of Eden</strong>—the original state of imagination perfectly assumed—and the sensual honey of the <em>Song of Solomon</em> recur throughout the Bible narrative. These motifs illustrate the ongoing process of <strong>assuming and living from the end</strong>, which is the fundamental law behind all manifestation.</p>
<p>The spiritual journey shown in Scripture is really a psychological journey—returning to the state of assumption where the desired end is already fulfilled within consciousness.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Bible as a Symbolic Guide to the Law of Assumption</h3>
<p>The Bible, in its layered storytelling, conceals these laws in historical narratives. Jonathan’s honeycomb experience and the honey metaphors in <em>Song of Solomon</em> both show how <strong>the right feeling assumed—regardless of outer circumstances—shifts consciousness and brings about manifestation</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: The Sweetness of Assumed Accomplishment</h3>
<p>The Bible’s outer narrative offers form, but the <strong>inner meaning is a guide to the creative law of imagination and assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Jonathan tasting honey on the battlefield and the beloved’s sweetness in the <em>Song of Solomon</em> share the same message: the <strong>feeling of living in the end, the assumption of accomplished desire, is the true creative power</strong>.</p>
<p>When you assume the feeling of your fulfilled wish—“tasting the honey”—you bring about a shift in consciousness that manifests your desired reality.</p>
