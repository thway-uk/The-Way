<h1>Colours: Black and White</h1>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.”</strong> — Genesis 1:1-2</blockquote><p></p>
<p>The Bible <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">opens with a symbol of the creative process</a>: the earth is initially <strong>formless and void</strong>, covered in <strong>darkness</strong>. This darkness represents the <strong>unmanifest imagination</strong>, the invisible potential waiting to be shaped into reality. Neville Goddard teaches that all manifestation begins in this unseen imaginative state before becoming visible.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Laban’s Name: White as Formed Manifestation</h3>
<p>Fast forward to the story of Jacob and Laban, where Laban’s name means <strong>“white”</strong> in Hebrew. This is highly significant when understood through biblical symbolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>White</strong> represents the <strong>formed, manifested reality</strong>—the visible and tangible world, the fixed beliefs and assumptions we inhabit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Black (or darkness)</strong> stands for the <strong>formless, unmanifest imagination</strong>, the fertile ground of potential that has not yet taken shape.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Laban embodies this <strong>old formed state of consciousness</strong>—the established patterns and conditioned beliefs that Jacob must leave behind in order to manifest a new reality.</p>

<h3>The Beloved’s Face is Black: The Beauty of the Unformed Imagination</h3>
<p>In the Song of Solomon (Song of Songs 1:5), the beloved says:</p>
<p><em>“I am black but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem.”</em></p>
<p>Here, <strong>black</strong> symbolises the <strong>hidden, unformed imagination</strong>—the fertile mystery beneath the surface, beautiful and powerful even though unseen. This reflects the <strong>formless creative state</strong> from which all manifestation springs.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Ethiopian Eunuch: Blackness and Spiritual Awakening</h3>
<p>In <strong>Acts 8:26-40</strong>, Philip meets the Ethiopian eunuch, a figure from a land associated with blackness. This encounter is deeply symbolic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The eunuch’s blackness represents the <strong>unformed, hidden state of consciousness</strong>—the fertile imagination yet to be fully awakened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His journey, culminating in baptism, symbolises the <strong>awakening and transformation of this hidden state into a new, conscious identity</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This narrative mirrors the broader biblical theme of moving from darkness (formless imagination) to light (manifested reality and conscious awareness), aligning perfectly with Neville Goddard’s teachings on imagination and manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jesus’ Teaching: “The Fields Are White for Harvest”</h3>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<p><em>“Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.”</em> — John 4:35</p>
<p>The <strong>white fields</strong> symbolise the <strong>manifested reality that is ripe and ready to be reaped</strong>. This connects directly with Laban’s symbolism as “white”—the <strong>formed state that has been brought forth through imagination and is now ready to be fully embraced and experienced</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Supporting Biblical Examples of Black and White Symbolism</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isaiah 1:18</strong> — <em>“Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow.”</em><br />
This verse symbolises purification and transformation from the flawed formed state (scarlet) to the pure manifested reality (white).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revelation 3:5</strong> — <em>“He who overcomes will be clothed like them in white garments.”</em><br />
White garments represent the new, purified state of consciousness and the full manifestation of spiritual victory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalm 23:4</strong> — <em>“Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.”</em><br />
The “shadow” evokes the blackness of the formless imaginative state, a necessary passage before reaching peace and manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 17:2</strong> — Jesus’ transfiguration where his clothes became dazzling white symbolises the manifestation of divine consciousness — the full expression of imagined reality in pure form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zechariah 3:3-5</strong> — Joshua’s filthy garments replaced with white robes symbolises the inner transformation from the old limiting formed self to the new manifested identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Journey from Black to White: Neville Goddard’s Perspective</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard’s teachings show that our inner work moves us from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Black (darkness) — the formless imagination, the unmanifest potential</strong><br />
to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>White — the formed, manifested reality, the outer world we experience.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacob’s story symbolises this inner transition: leaving Laban (the old formed state of consciousness) means consciously moving beyond inherited beliefs and fully assuming a new state of being. The beloved’s black face reminds us that the unseen imagination is not to be feared but embraced as the source of creative power. The Ethiopian eunuch’s awakening shows this process in action. Jesus’ white fields show the final harvest, the manifestation of that power.</p>
