<h1>Hebrew Name Meanings in the Genealogy of Matthew</h1>
<p></p><p>The first chapter of Matthew does not record the history of men. It records the unfoldment of states within the one being—your own wonderful I AMness. Hidden beneath the surface of names and begats is the journey of consciousness, descending from faith and praise to confusion and exile, then ascending again into dominion, restoration, and finally salvation.</p>
<p>Every name carries within it the shadow of a state. To read this genealogy rightly is to see the movements of your own inner man—from the call of Abraham to the birth of the Christ in you.</p>
<p>Below, we follow these names as they appear in Matthew’s account, with their Hebrew meanings offering glimpses into the stages of divine becoming:</p>

<hr />
<h3><strong>This Is Your Story</strong></h3>
<p>This is not the story of a family long gone. This is the story of you. The begats are not physical—they are psychological. Every name is a rung in the ladder by which you rise from man to God, from form to formless, from echo to origin.</p>
<p>The line leads to Jesus because it leads to the awakening of your true identity: the I AM in you, which was never born and will never die—but waits patiently to be remembered.</p>
