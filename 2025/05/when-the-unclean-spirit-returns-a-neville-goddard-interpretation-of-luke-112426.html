<h1>When the Unclean Spirit Returns: A Neville Goddard Interpretation of Luke 11:24–26</h1>
<p><strong>Scripture:</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>“When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br />
And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<br />
Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.”</em><br />
—Luke 11:24–26 (KJV)</p>
</blockquote><hr /><p>At first glance, this passage seems ominous—warning of demonic return and the worsening of one’s inner condition. But when read through the spiritual psychology of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, a profound symbolic message about the <strong>nature of consciousness and the necessity of transformation</strong> emerges.</p><h3><strong>The “Unclean Spirit” as an Old State of Being</strong></h3><p>Neville taught that every character, event, and image in the Bible represents a psychological state. The “unclean spirit” is not some external entity, but a <strong>limiting or destructive state of consciousness</strong>—a belief in lack, fear, bitterness, unworthiness, or any deeply held inner pattern that distorts the imagination.</p><p>To be freed from such a state is to shift inwardly: to assume a new concept of self, to awaken to “I AM” as the creative power, and to no longer identify with the old, limiting idea.</p><blockquote>
<p>“You are free to choose the state that you will occupy. But the state has its own consequences. So you must be willing to assume full responsibility for your life.”<br />
—Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><h3><strong>“Swept and Garnished”—But Still Empty</strong></h3><p>Once the unclean state has departed, the man’s house (his mind, his consciousness) is left <em>“swept and garnished.”</em> It looks good—tidied up, morally reformed, perhaps free from the outward symptoms of the former state.</p><p>But the warning here is subtle: it is not enough to remove an old state. One must <strong>replace it</strong> with something higher. The house may be clean, but if <strong>it is empty</strong>, it becomes a perfect space for the return of the old thoughts—with reinforcements.</p><h3><strong>Imagination Abhors a Vacuum</strong></h3><p>Neville constantly stressed that <strong>the imagination must be actively and purposefully directed</strong>. If you do not consciously fill your awareness with a new, life-giving assumption of self, your subconscious will drift back to what is familiar. And because the old state has been temporarily dislodged but not fully replaced, it often returns stronger—<em>“seven other spirits more wicked than himself.”</em></p><p>This is the relapse of the half-awakened soul. This is why one who momentarily escapes a negative cycle can fall back into it more destructively than before—because the break was outward, not inward; cosmetic, not creative.</p><h3><strong>True Reformation is Replacement, Not Suppression</strong></h3><p>In Neville's terms, <strong>you must imagine boldly</strong>. You must not only say “I no longer dwell in fear,” but rather, “I AM love. I AM courage. I AM secure.” The new state must become your new dwelling, the new habitation of your awareness.</p><p>This is the inner meaning of “Let the weak say, I am strong.” You don’t cleanse your mind by resisting darkness—you do it by assuming light.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Spiritual Message for Manifestation</strong></h2><p>Luke 11:24–26 reminds us that <strong>you cannot just stop thinking destructively—you must start imagining creatively</strong>. You cannot just renounce an old self—you must <strong>inhabit a new one</strong>.</p><p>In Neville’s language:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You must assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must persist in the assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must make it your dwelling, not a fleeting moment of desire.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Otherwise, the unclaimed vacuum of consciousness will be filled by what is familiar—and often, what is most unwanted.</p><hr /><p><strong>To “cast out the unclean spirit” is not to fight it—it is to rise above it. It is to ascend to a state that no longer includes it.</strong> The danger lies not in the evil spirit, but in the empty space left behind when we fail to plant new imaginative seeds in the soil of the subconscious.</p><p>So, what shall you fill your house with today?</p>
