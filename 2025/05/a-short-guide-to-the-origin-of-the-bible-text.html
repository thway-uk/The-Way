<h1>A Short Guide to the Origin of the Bible Text</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. The Bible wasn’t written all at once.</strong></h3>
<p>Think of it like a <strong>library</strong>, not one book. Different bits were written over <strong>hundreds of years</strong>, then gathered together later.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. It started as stories people told each other.</strong></h3>
<p>Before anything was written down, people <strong>told stories</strong> out loud. These were passed down for <strong>generations</strong>, especially around <strong>3,000 years ago</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Writing began around 2,900 years ago.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>oldest parts</strong> (like poems and early laws) started getting written around <strong>900 BCE</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s about <strong>2,925 years ago</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. The Old Testament came together over time.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Different scrolls and books were written and edited over centuries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By about <strong>2,200 years ago</strong>, most of it looked like what we have now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. The New Testament came much later.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Around <strong>2,000 years ago</strong>, people started writing about Jesus—his life, teachings, and what it meant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters by Paul (a big early Christian writer) came first, around <strong>1,975 years ago</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, etc.) followed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>6. It got collected into one book later.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All the texts were copied and shared, and eventually <strong>organised into one book</strong> we now call "The Bible."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This took <strong>a few hundred more years</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>TL;DR:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bible stories were first <strong>told by word of mouth</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First writing: <strong>about 2,900 years ago</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Testament: <strong>about 2,000 years ago</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All put together into “The Bible”: later on, over time.</p></li></ul>
