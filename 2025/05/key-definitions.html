<h1>Key Definitions</h1>
<br /><br />This is an initial list to assist a reader in the foundational picturing of symbolism.<br /><br />God is your “I AM” — seated in imagination. (Exodus 3:14)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 1:2<br /><br />“The Spirit of God hovered over the waters” Spirit (consciousness) and soul (subconscious) unite in creative stillness.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 1:11<br /><br />“The seed is in itself” Creation begins within imagination — what you assume bears fruit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 1:26<br /><br />“Let Us make man in Our image” Imagination is conscious and subconscious joined. “Man” is who you are aware of being, your perception of self, not a physical man.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 2:23<br /><br />“Bone of my bones”<br /><br />Life and form emanate from imagination — the outer drawn from the inner.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 2:24<br /><br />"cleave to his wife"<br /><br />Begins the symbolic journey of love and union in imagination.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Genesis 4:7<br /><br />“Sin is crouching at the door… but you must master it.”<br /><br />Sin = failure to imagine lovingly. Choose honour, not fear.
