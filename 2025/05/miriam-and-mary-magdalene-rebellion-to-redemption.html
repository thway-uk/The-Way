<h1>Miriam and Mary Magdalene: Rebellion to Redemption</h1>
<p>The name <em>Mary</em>—rooted in the Hebrew <em>Miriam</em>—is often translated as <strong>bitterness </strong><i><a href="/2025/05/ruths-loyalty-and-naomis-rebirth.html">(see Naomi and Ruth)</a></i>, <strong>beloved</strong>, or even <strong>rebellion</strong>. These meanings seem contradictory at first glance, but they form a coherent and transformative arc when viewed through the teachings of Neville Goddard.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, <strong>Miriam</strong>—the sister of Moses—is a strong and vocal figure. She sings deliverance songs and later questions Moses’ unique spiritual authority. For this, she is struck with leprosy, separated, and only later restored. Miriam is not punished for wickedness, but for <strong>daring to assert a voice equal to revelation</strong>. Her “rebellion” is symbolic of the subconscious habit <strong>challenging surface mind authority.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Now, moving forward to the New Testament, we encounter <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>, a key <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> described as having <a href="/2025/04/the-seven-devils-cast-out-of-mary.html">seven devils cast out</a>. In Neville’s language, these "devils" represent the rebellious and distorted states of mind that mirror Miriam's earlier resistance. The casting out of these devils reflects the <strong>purification</strong> of the subconscious from false beliefs. Mary Magdalene is not meek; she is bold, emotional, and ultimately the first to witness the risen Jesus. Her role not only symbolizes the subconscious mind <strong>freed</strong> from illusions but also mirrors Jesus’ healing work—just as Jesus, the conscious mind, performs miracles, so too does Mary Magdalene, the purified subconscious, reflect this transformation and healing. She is aligned with the power of the conscious mind’s imagination, fully ready to bring forth the new creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Miriam becomes Magdalene.</strong> Rebellion becomes a loving, attentive and devoted witness.</p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>The Seven Devils as States of Misalignment</strong></h3>
<p>Neville taught that sin means to "miss the mark"—to deviate from the true assumption of your desired state. Mary Magdalene, then, is the story of <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-seven-devils-cast-out-of-mary.html">a mind previously aligned with seven false states</a></strong>: shame, fear, dependency, guilt, resentment, lack, and perhaps powerlessness. When these are cast out—<em>not by condemnation, but by a shift in awareness</em>—she becomes the <strong>first to see truth resurrected.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Miriam's rebellion is not a mistake—it is a foreshadowing.</strong><br />
<strong>Mary Magdalene’s restoration is not an ending—it is a return to original power.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Evolution of Inner Rebellion</strong></h3>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s symbolic interpretation, we see the Bible not as separate stories, but as one ongoing inner drama. Miriam and Mary Magdalene are two expressions of the <strong>same subconscious principle</strong>—first defiant, then refined, then radiant. Rebellion was never the problem. It was the beginning of redemption.</p>
