<h1>Heaven and Heaven of Heavens Cannot Contain Him: Devotional</h1>
<p><em>Reflections on 2 Chronicles 2:5</em></p>
<p>We do not build temples of stone alone. Every thought, every assumption, every act of faith is a brick laid in the sanctuary of the soul. This verse from 2 Chronicles reminds us how great the work truly is — and how the divine presence we honour cannot be contained, only consciously hosted.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“And the house which I build is great:”</strong></h3>
<p><em>The house is consciousness. Your inner structure must be expansive enough to carry the truth you choose to embody.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“for great is our God above all gods.”</strong></h3>
<p><em>The I AM within you is supreme. It creates not by force, but by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“But who is able to build Him an house,”</strong></h3>
<p><em>Can imagination ever fully contain the Infinite? We craft symbols — states — but He remains beyond all form.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain Him?”</strong></h3>
<p><em>Even your highest ideals cannot confine the source of life. The divine is limitless — and so is your creative potential.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“who am I then, that I should build Him an house,”</strong></h3>
<p><em>This question marks the turning point: the old self feels unworthy — but the awakened self knows it must build anyway.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>“save only to burn sacrifice before Him?”</strong></h3>
<p><em>The only true offering is your former state. Burn it in the fire of belief, and rise in the form of what you now accept as true.</em></p>
