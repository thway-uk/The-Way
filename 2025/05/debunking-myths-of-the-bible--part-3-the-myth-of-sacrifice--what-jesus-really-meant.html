<h1>Debunking Myths of the Bible — Part 3: The Myth of Sacrifice — What Jesus Really Meant</h1>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> <em>“Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross was a punishment to pay for humanity’s sins—without it, we cannot be saved.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> <em>The “sacrifice” is a powerful symbol of surrendering old beliefs and fixing a new reality through imagination. It’s about inner transformation, not external punishment.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>✝️ Sacrifice in Traditional Christianity</h2>
<p>Mainstream doctrine often presents Jesus’ death as a <strong>legal payment</strong> for sin, making salvation possible only through acceptance of this one-time sacrifice.</p>
<p>This view can leave people feeling powerless, guilty, or dependent on an external saviour to “cleanse” them.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🔥 Sacrifice as Symbol: The Inner Shift</h2>
<p>Neville Goddard teaches that the Bible is an allegory of consciousness and imagination.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “sacrifice” is the <strong>fixing of an assumption</strong> in the subconscious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cross is the <strong>point of transformation</strong> where the old identity dies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus’ “death” symbolizes <strong>the letting go of limiting beliefs</strong> and the birth of a new self.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>✨ The Cross: A Meeting Point of Death and Creation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed... Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.”</em><br />
— Luke 22:41–42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus’ prayer shows surrender—not defeat. This is the moment of releasing resistance and embracing a new state.</p>
<p>The cross represents this <strong>inner surrender</strong>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The old “self” (with doubt, fear, and limitation) is crucified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new “self” (faithful, creative, and free) is born.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>🕊️ Resurrection: The Proof of Imagination’s Power</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He is not here, but is risen...”</em><br />
— Luke 24:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resurrection is not just a miraculous event but a <strong>symbol of awakening</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your imagination has the power to “raise” your life from old patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resurrection is the <strong>manifestation of your new assumption</strong> becoming your reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t need to wait for an external saviour. The power lies in <strong>your imagination</strong> to assume the feeling of the fulfilled desire and to let go of the old self.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🌟 Embrace Your Inner Sacrifice</h2>
<p>Sacrifice is not about loss or punishment but <strong>the necessary step of inner transformation</strong>—crucifying old doubts and fears so your true self can emerge.</p>
<p>This is how you walk your own path back to Eden: by consciously choosing which beliefs to “sacrifice” and which new realities to birth.</p>
