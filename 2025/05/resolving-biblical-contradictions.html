<h1>Resolving Biblical Contradictions</h1>
<p>When the Bible is read as literal history, many contradictions and inconsistencies arise that can confuse or frustrate readers. However, Neville Goddard revealed a practical and structured way to understand the Bible: not as a record of external events, but as an allegory of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>, imagination, and inner transformation. In this view, the Bible itself is teaching us through symbolic stories how our own states of being evolve.</p>
<p>Here are ten common biblical contradictions and how Neville’s revelations show they are resolved when understood symbolically:</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Creation Timeline: Six Days or Millions of Years?</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
Genesis 1 describes the world created in six days, but science shows the Earth formed over billions of years.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
The “six days” represent stages or <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">phases of consciousness awakening within us</a>. Each “day” symbolises a new level of awareness or creative power in the imagination. Creation is the inner unfolding of self-awareness, not an external event.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Two Different Creation Accounts in Genesis</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 give different <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">creation</a> versions with conflicting details and order.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
These accounts symbolise two aspects of imagination. Genesis 1 portrays universal creative power; Genesis 2 focuses on the individual inner self. The Bible teaches us through these narratives how imagination works on both universal and personal levels.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Noah’s Flood: Global Disaster or Mental Reset?</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
A worldwide flood is scientifically impossible and uncorroborated.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
The flood symbolises the cleansing or washing away of old limiting mental states to prepare for new consciousness. It teaches how transformation often requires letting go of outdated beliefs.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Different Genealogies for Jesus in Matthew and Luke</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br /><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Matthew’s and Luke’s</a> genealogies for Jesus differ significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
The genealogies represent different spiritual paths leading to the “Christ” or higher self. The Bible teaches through these varied lineages how diverse states of consciousness culminate in divine realisation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. God’s Nature: Loving Father or Wrathful Judge?</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
God is depicted as both merciful and wrathful.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br /><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God symbolises imagination</a> itself—creative and sometimes destructive to old forms. The Bible shows us how imagination’s dynamic power shapes transformation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Resurrection Accounts Vary Among the Gospels</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
The <a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-of-manifestation.html">Gospels</a> give different details about Jesus’ resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
The resurrection symbolises inner awakening to a new identity. Different accounts reflect varied perspectives on this spiritual rebirth.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Saul’s Jealousy vs. David’s Respect</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
Saul is hostile to David, who nevertheless honours Saul.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
Saul and David symbolise the old self resisting and the new self emerging. The Bible teaches about the inner struggle and eventual transformation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. “An Eye for an Eye” vs. “Turn the Other Cheek”</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
Old Testament justice contrasts with Jesus’ teachings of forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
These are stages of consciousness—the external, literal justice vs. higher <a href="/2025/07/cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">spiritual forgiveness</a>. The Bible instructs on the progression of inner maturity.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. Unfulfilled or Vague Prophecies</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
Some prophecies seem unfulfilled or ambiguous.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
Prophecies are symbolic visions of inner realities, teaching how imagination creates possibilities rather than fixed events.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. The Trinity vs. Strict Monotheism</h3>
<p><strong>Literal contradiction:</strong><br />
The Old Testament’s strict monotheism contrasts with the New Testament Trinity.</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s revelation:</strong><br />
The Trinity symbolises aspects of the one imagination—source, manifestation, and creative power. The Bible reveals the complexity of imagination’s workings.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard did not invent these ideas but revealed the symbolism already taught by the Bible itself. When understood as an allegory of imagination and consciousness, the Bible’s apparent contradictions dissolve. It becomes a coherent guide to personal transformation, showing us how to manifest new realities by shifting inner states of being.</p>
