<h1>Signs and Wonders: Imagination in Action</h1>
<p>The Bible is full of <em>“signs and wonders.”</em> Seas part, fire falls from heaven, the dead rise, and the sick are healed. To the literal mind, these are external miracles—suspensions of natural law. But to those who’ve discovered the secret behind Neville Goddard’s teachings, something else is being revealed: <em>these are not external interventions, but internal breakthroughs.</em> These signs and wonders are the visible results of an invisible process—<em>imagination in action</em>.</p>
<p>Neville taught that the Bible is not a record of outer events, but a psychological blueprint. Every character, every event, every miracle is symbolic of something happening in you. When the Bible says “with signs and wonders the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,” it is saying that <em>through the power of imaginative conviction, man is lifted out of bondage to his current circumstances</em>.</p>

<h3><strong>What Are Signs and Wonders, Really?</strong></h3>
<p>A “<b>sign</b>” is the <b>echo</b> of an internal <b>assumption</b> made real. A “<b><i>wonder</i></b>” is the natural result of <b><i>consciousness</i></b> <b><i>shifting</i></b> so fully into a new state that the outer world must comply. These are not interruptions of reality—they <em>are</em> reality, unfolding from a deeper level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses turning his rod into a serpent</strong> is not sleight of hand—it’s a sign that the rigid line of belief (the rod) can be quickened into creative energy (the serpent) through focused imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elijah calling down fire</strong> symbolises the fiery determination that burns through resistance. It is not fire from above—it is passion from within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus healing the blind and lame</strong> is imagination beholding someone in a new state—and that state becoming flesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The loaves and fishes multiplying</strong> isn’t a trick—it’s a demonstration of how even the smallest seed of belief, once felt as real, can feed the multitude of your world.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Why Signs Follow, Not Lead</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“These signs shall follow those who believe…” (Mark 16:17)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: <em>follow</em>. Not precede. The inner conviction comes first—the miracle is the effect, not the cause. Signs don’t produce belief; they <em>prove</em> it. They are the shadow cast by a new assumption. They are imagination wearing form.</p>
<p>Neville often said, <em>“You can’t persist in imagining a state and not express it.”</em> That expression—whether healing, freedom, abundance, or peace—is your sign and wonder. It is the world echoing back what you dared to believe in the silence.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>You Are the Sign</strong></h3>
<p>You are not here to chase signs—you <em>are</em> the sign. Your transformation, your unfolding, your movement from one state of being to another, <em>is the wonder</em>. The parting of the Red Sea is your breakthrough. The raising of Lazarus is your buried dream returning. These aren’t ancient stories—they are your autobiography in symbols.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Miracle Has Already Begun</strong></h3>
<p>So the next time you read of some astonishing event in Scripture, ask yourself: <em>What is this showing me about imagination?</em> You may find that the miracle has already begun.</p>
