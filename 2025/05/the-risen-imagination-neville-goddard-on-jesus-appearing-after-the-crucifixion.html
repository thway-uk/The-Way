<h1>The Risen Imagination: Neville Goddard on Jesus Appearing After the Crucifixion</h1>
<blockquote><p>Peace be unto you.”<em>(John 20:19)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>These are the first words spoken by the risen Jesus to His disciples, gathered behind closed doors in fear and disbelief. To the literalist, this may be a moment of divine mystery. But in the framework of Neville Goddard, this is no supernatural event—it is the unveiling of a profound psychological truth: your own <strong>I AM awareness</strong>, once crucified to an idea, returns in transformed assurance.</p><hr /><h3>The Crucifixion as Psychological Fixation</h3><p>Neville taught that the crucifixion symbolises the moment a new state of consciousness is firmly impressed upon the subconscious mind. This is not death, but the death of the old man—the old self-image—and the beginning of something new.</p><blockquote>
<p>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me…” <em>(Galatians 2:20)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You no longer merely hope for a change. You have assumed the new identity. You have “died” to what you were and fixed yourself upon what you desire to be.</p><hr /><h3>The Resurrection: Inner Assurance</h3><p>Then comes the resurrection—the moment when what you’ve imagined begins to assert itself. You start to feel calm. Confident. At peace, even though nothing has yet changed externally.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.” <em>(John 20:20)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This joy is the sign that the inner work has begun to bear fruit. You are no longer doubting. You are knowing.</p><hr /><h3>Breaking Through the Locked Room</h3><blockquote>
<p>“The doors were shut… came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.” <em>(John 20:19)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The closed room symbolises the limitations of reason and the senses. But the I AM—your imagination—is not bound by these doors. It appears despite the odds. The assumed state begins to break through what once seemed impossible.</p><hr /><h3>Doubting Thomas: The Demand for Proof</h3><p>Even still, there is a part of us that doubts. That wants evidence before belief.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Except I shall see… I will not believe.” <em>(John 20:25)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Thomas represents the part of consciousness that refuses to believe without proof. But Jesus answers:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” <em>(John 20:29)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Neville’s central message: <strong>Believe first—then it shall appear.</strong></p><hr /><h3>Eating the Fish and Honeycomb: Embodying the Assumed State</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them.” <em>(Luke 24:42–43)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus eating in front of His disciples symbolises the assimilation of the new state into the everyday. The imagined has become tangible. The spiritual has entered the physical.</p><hr /><h3>The Vanishing: When You Become the State</h3><blockquote>
<p>“And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.” <em>(Luke 24:31)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus vanishes because there is no more need for separation between the “imagined” and the “real.” The assumed state has become you. The outer and inner are one.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Risen Imagination is You</h3><p>When you persist in imagining, despite fear, despite locked doors, despite doubt—your resurrection is inevitable. The risen Jesus is not someone outside you, but the return of your <strong>own imagination</strong>, triumphant.</p><p>
