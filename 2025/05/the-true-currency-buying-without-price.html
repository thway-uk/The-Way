<h1>The True Currency: Buying Without Price</h1>
<p><strong>A Neville Goddard Interpretation of Money in Scripture</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Ho! Everyone in need, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, get grain without money; wine and milk without price.”</em><br />
— <em>Isaiah 55:1, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Bible, money is often mentioned, but it's rarely about the <strong>currency</strong> we think of. It’s about <strong>value</strong>—and the <strong>true wealth</strong> that comes from within.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>1. Isaiah 55:1 – The Invitation to Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>This is not an invitation to ritual. It is a call to the <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>thirst</strong> is your desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>waters</strong> are the subconscious—the flow of life itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>milk and wine</strong>? <em>Milk</em> is truth in its simplest, nurturing form; <em>wine</em> is inspiration and insight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need money. You need only to <strong>assume the state</strong> of the one who has what they long for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.” – <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how you “buy without price.” It costs nothing but your <strong>belief</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. Revelation 3:18 – True Riches</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If you will take my advice, get from me gold tested by fire, so that you may be truly rich…”</em><br />
— <em>Revelation 3:18, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>gold tried in fire</strong> is your imagination, refined through experience. The “true riches” are <strong>states of consciousness</strong>—awakened states that lead to manifestation.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Proverbs 23:23 – The Currency of Wisdom</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Get wisdom, and do not give up your money for it; get true knowledge and good sense.”</em><br />
— <em>Proverbs 23:23</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wisdom cannot be bought with silver or gold. It is gained through <strong>attention to your inner world</strong>. In Neville’s teachings, paying attention to your assumptions is the real “currency” of creation.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. Matthew 10:8 – Freely Give</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Freely ye have received, freely give.”</em><br />
— <em>Matthew 10:8 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gifts of Spirit—love, health, creation—cannot be purchased with money. They are freely available through <strong>imagination</strong>. What you freely receive, you must also freely give to the world.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. Acts 8:20 – The Illusion of Buying God’s Gifts</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!”</em><br />
— <em>Acts 8:20</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true gifts of the Divine—creativity, healing, manifestation—are not transactional in the material sense. They are activated through <strong>assumption</strong>, not external wealth.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The True Wealth</strong></h3>
<p>All these scriptures point to the same truth:<br />
<strong>True wealth</strong> is not found in money—it is found in <strong>the power of imagination</strong>. The abundance of the universe is unlocked when we assume the <strong>feeling of the wish fulfilled</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The only true currency is your imagination."</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t need wealth, status, or ritual. You need only the <strong>inner richness</strong> that comes from assuming what you wish to experience.</p>
