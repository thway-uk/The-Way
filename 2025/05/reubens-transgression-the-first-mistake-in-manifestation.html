<h1>Reuben’s Transgression: The First Mistake in Manifestation</h1>
<p>Reuben’s transgression in Genesis 35:22, when he goes up to his father’s bed, is symbolic of a failure in the process of manifestation. In Neville Goddard's teachings, this act represents the struggle of moving beyond human planning, old beliefs and assumptions to fully embrace the creative power of the imagination.</p><h4><strong>Reuben: "Behold, a Son"</strong></h4><p>Reuben’s name means "Behold, a son," symbolizing the potential for manifestation and new beginnings. As the firstborn, he holds the power to create through imagination. However, his failure to step into this creative power reveals the dangers of clinging to past beliefs rather than boldly embracing the power to manifest.</p><h4><strong>The Father’s Bed: Outdated Beliefs</strong></h4><p>In Neville’s framework, the <strong>father</strong> represents the old self or past state of consciousness, while the <strong>bed</strong> symbolises comfort and stagnation. Reuben’s act of returning to his father’s bed shows his attachment to outdated beliefs and an unwillingness to break free from the past. This prevents him from fully stepping into his creative potential.</p><h4><strong>Bilhah: The Timid Subconscious</strong></h4><p>Bilhah, the concubine, symbolises a <strong>passive subconscious</strong> that is influenced by fear and doubt. A timid subconscious cannot manifest boldly. It’s unclear and hesitant, and Neville teaches that such a subconscious cannot bring desires into reality with power.</p><h4><strong>Reuben’s Mistake: Holding onto the Past</strong></h4><p>Reuben's mistake was clinging to the past, allowing old assumptions and limiting beliefs to govern his actions. Instead of embracing his imagination's full creative power, he yielded to fear and doubt, which prevented strong manifestation. Jacob’s words in Genesis 49:3-4 highlight Reuben’s instability, showing that his lack of confidence in his creative power led to failure.</p><h4><strong>The Lesson: Bold Assumptions Lead to Manifestation</strong></h4><p>Reuben’s story teaches that manifestation requires confidence and boldness. To manifest effectively, you must align your subconscious with your desires and live in the assumption of the wish fulfilled. A passive subconscious, influenced by outdated beliefs, will always hinder manifestation. Reuben’s failure was in not stepping forward into his creative power, which is the essence of Neville’s teachings.</p><h4><strong>Conclusion: Embrace Your Creative Power</strong></h4><p>Reuben’s transgression warns against holding onto the past. To manifest your desires, you must release old beliefs and embrace a confident, active subconscious mind. Only by doing so can you harness the full power of your imagination and create the life you desire.</p>
