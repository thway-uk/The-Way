<h1>Sackcloth and Ashes: The State That Feels Wrong Because It Is</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, everything hinges on <em>assumption</em>. You do not attract what you want—you <em>express</em> what you are. Every experience flows from the state you occupy. In this light, <em>sackcloth and ashes</em> are not signs of repentance in the traditional sense—they are the symbolic indicators that you’ve assumed a state that no longer serves you.</p><p><strong>Sackcloth</strong> represents the psychological discomfort of wearing the wrong identity. It is the scratchy, abrasive feeling of thinking thoughts that contradict the truth of who you really are. It shows up as discouragement, lack, or inner tension—the soul’s reaction to wearing an assumption out of harmony with “I AM.”</p><p><strong>Ashes</strong> are the dead residue of past beliefs. They’re what’s left when the fires of imagination have been burned through by long-held but limiting self-concepts. When you feel you’ve reached the end of yourself, when nothing external seems to answer—you are often sitting in ashes, ready to rise.</p><p>This inner dynamic is perfectly captured in <strong>Job 42:5–6</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."</em><br />
— <em>Job 42:5–6 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Job, the archetype of suffering while still assuming righteousness, reaches the moment of breakthrough. The <em>hearing of the ear</em> represents intellectual belief—secondhand knowledge of God as something external. The <em>eye</em> symbolises direct experience: the awakening to <em>I AM</em> within. When this shift occurs, Job says he "abhors" his former self—not out of guilt, but because he recognises the false state he was inhabiting. The repentance in ashes is the rejection of the old assumption.</p><p>As Neville wrote, <em>“You rise by appropriating the feeling of already being what you want to be.”</em> Sackcloth and ashes are not moral punishments; they are the emotional and spiritual discomfort of living in a state too small for who you now know yourself to be. The moment you <em>feel</em> that discomfort fully, you are standing on the threshold of change.</p><p>And when the assumption changes, everything else must follow.</p>
