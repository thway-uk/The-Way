<h1>Mary: Repetition of Mary in the New Testament</h1>
<p>At first glance, the New Testament seems curiously crowded with women named Mary.</p><p>There’s Mary, the mother of Jesus; <b>Mary Magdalene</b>, the devoted follower; <b>Mary of Bethany</b>, the <b>Mary contemplative sister of Lazarus</b>—and others still. Why this repetition?</p><p>Most historians explain it away as a popular name of the time. But through the symbolic understanding shared in Neville Goddard’s teachings, the recurrence of “Mary” carries greater meaning.</p><p>Each Mary is an <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">expression of the woman first defined ind in Genesis</a>. <strong>"Mary"</strong> represents the <i><b>beloved</b></i> aspect of mind that receives and responds to the Word—that is, to <a href="https://www.thway.uk/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a>. Though they appear in different roles, the Marys are not separate characters, but different functions of one creative principle.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Three Faces of the Faithful Subconscious</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary, the mother of Jesus</strong>: the subconscious as womb—receiving the idea and bringing forth manifestation without question or effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>: the redeemed subconscious—once possessed by false assumptions (“seven devils”), now awakened and faithful to the risen truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary of Bethany</strong>: the contemplative inner stillness—resting at the feet of the Word while the outer mind (Martha) remains busy and distracted.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each Mary reveals what the subconscious does when aligned with truth.</p><hr /><h3><strong>From Fragmented to Unified</strong></h3><p>The Old Testament gives us the subconscious in fragments—expressed through symbolic women:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: under the perception of barriness and undervalued persistence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: under the perception of the cherished desires of the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bilhah & Zilpah</strong>: under the perception of external limitations, that ignore imagination as the creative power</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These women reflect aspects of the mind—faithful, longing, productive, overlooked.<br />
But in the New Testament, all of these traits are drawn together under one name: <strong>Mary</strong>.</p><p>She is the unified field of receptivity. The sacred ground in which the Word is sown.</p><hr /><h3><strong>From Miriam to Magdalene: The Rebellion Refined</strong></h3><p>Even the original <em><a href="/2025/05/miriam-mary-as-rebellious-woman.html">Miriam</a></em>—the Old Testament origin of the name Mary—holds symbolic weight.<br />
Miriam was a singer, a prophetess, and a challenger of structure. Her “rebellion” symbolised the responsive mind resisting control by surface mind—demanding its rightful role in spiritual unfolding.</p><p>This rebellious undercurrent transforms by the New Testament into <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong>: a woman once gripped by seven devils (false beliefs or misaligned states), now cleared, faithful, and the first to see resurrection.</p><p><strong>Miriam becomes Magdalene.</strong> Rebellion becomes revelation.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Why So Many Marys?</strong></h3><p>Because there is <strong>one beloved field of creation</strong>—and many stages of revelation.<br />
Because the subconscious is not passive, but:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith in action</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Love in waiting</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Devotion in form</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Marys of the New Testament are not many women.<br />
They are <strong>one truth</strong>, faithfully expressed at every turn of the story.</p><p>They are the subconscious made visible—ready, willing, and full of grace.</p><p><br /></p>
