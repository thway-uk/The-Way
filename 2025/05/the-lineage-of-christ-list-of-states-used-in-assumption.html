<hr /><h3>Using Genealogy Overview</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew divides the line into three sets of 14 generations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>From Abraham to David</p></li>
    <li><p>From David to the Babylonian exile</p></li>
    <li><p>From the exile to Christ</p></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

<h3>The Symbolism of the Three Sets of 14 Generations</h3>
  <p>
    In Neville’s framework, the three sets of 14 generations symbolise the complete cycle of manifestation through the Law of Assumption. The number 14, being 
    <a href="/2025/05/the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">twice</a> 7, reflects a doubling of 
    <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">spiritual perfection and completion</a>—7 itself representing wholeness and divine order. This 
    <a href="/2025/05/the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">doubling also echoes the creation story in Genesis, where creation unfolds in two distinct phases</a>, 
    reinforcing the idea of a full, deliberate process of bringing the imagined reality into existence. Each set of 14 marks a key stage in the evolution of self-deception—
    from awakening the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM”</a> identity, through refinement and persistence, to the final realisation of the desired state—
    mapping the inner journey of assuming and manifesting your vision.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>First set (Abraham to David):</strong> This stage symbolises the initial establishment of faith and identity — the planting of the seed state of consciousness. 
      It is the <span class="name-meaning">“fathering” of a multitude</span>, the <span class="name-meaning">joyful expectation</span>, and the mastering of inner contradictions, 
      culminating in the <span class="name-meaning">beloved</span> David, the foundational “I AM” assumption made stable and loved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Second set (David to the exile):</strong> This represents the testing, refinement, and expansion of the assumed state. The soul faces challenges and trials (exile), 
      requiring persistence, right judgment, and healing. It is the period where faith is stretched and faithfulness is deepened — necessary to transform the initial assumption into 
      a state ready for manifestation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Third set (exile to Christ):</strong> This final stage is the actualisation and rebirth of the assumption into physical reality. 
      It includes <span class="name-meaning">divine establishment</span>, <span class="name-meaning">praise</span>, <span class="name-meaning">help</span>, and continuous growth. 
      The exile’s limitation is overcome, leading to the full <span class="name-meaning">deliverance</span> and <span class="name-meaning">salvation</span> embodied in Jesus — 
      the ultimate fulfilment of the Law of Assumption.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-weight: 400;">
    Together, the three sets of 14 mark a symbolic cycle of <strong>seed, struggle, and harvest</strong>, 
    illustrating the inner process through which a wish is assumed, refined, and finally realised.

<h3>Lineage as Assumptive Prompts</h3>
<p>
  Reflect on each meaning and spend a moment ‘living’ its feeling. With Neville’s Law of Assumption, 
  it’s not the story that matters but the felt reality behind it. Let these names guide you through the entire sweep of belief—
  from the <span class="name-meaning">father of nations</span> to your own <span class="name-meaning">deliverance</span>. 
  Once you’ve felt it, persist in that state, and witness your desired life unfold.
