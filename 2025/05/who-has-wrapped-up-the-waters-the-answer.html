<h1>"Who Has Wrapped Up the Waters?": The Answer</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard's framework, the Bible is a profound text that speaks not of historical events but also of the <strong>inner workings of consciousness</strong> and <strong>the power of imagination</strong>. A perfect example of this can be found in Proverbs 30:4, a verse that, when examined deeply, reveals layers of meaning regarding our divine creative power. Specifically, the <strong>repetition of the word "who"</strong> in this verse is key, and it ultimately points to the <strong>answer</strong> that Neville Goddard consistently emphasised from Exodus 3:14: <strong>"I AM" </strong></p><p>This article will focus on how the repetition of "who" in this verse draws attention to the <strong>divine creative power within each of us</strong>, pointing directly to the <strong>"<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>" awareness of being</strong>— the central pillar of Neville’s teachings on manifestation.</p><h3><strong>The Verse: Proverbs 30:4 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>"Who has gone up to heaven, and come down? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?"</em></p><p>At first glance, this passage might appear like a series of mysterious questions without an obvious answer. However, when read through the lens of Neville Goddard’s interpretation, the repetition of the word <strong>"who"</strong> serves as a powerful clue to the source of all creation — the <strong>"I AM"</strong> consciousness.</p><h3><strong>The Repetition of "Who": A Deeper Look</strong></h3><p>The repetition of the word <strong>"who"</strong> in this verse isn’t simply a rhetorical device or a literary flourish; it is a <strong>deliberate call to look within</strong> for the answer. In Neville’s teachings, <strong>"who"</strong> points to the <strong>creative power within the individual</strong> — the <strong>"I AM"</strong>.</p><p>When you ask “Who has gone up to heaven?” you are asking, in essence, who has the power to ascend to a higher state of consciousness. The answer is <strong>"I AM"</strong>. When you ask “Who has gathered the wind in his fists?” you are pointing to <strong>the power of your imagination</strong>, the invisible yet tangible force that shapes your reality. Again, the answer is <strong>"I AM"</strong>. This repetition highlights the singular source of creative power: <strong>you, the individual, as the embodiment of "I AM"</strong>.</p><p>Each of the questions points to aspects of creation, but they all ultimately ask the same thing: <strong>who is the creator?</strong> The answer is always the same — it is the <strong>"I AM"</strong> within each person, the consciousness that shapes reality through <strong>imagination</strong>.</p><h3><strong>"Who Has Gone Up to Heaven and Come Down?"</strong></h3><p>In Neville Goddard's teachings, <strong>heaven</strong> represents the state of imagination and the infinite realm of possibility. <strong>Ascending to heaven</strong> means entering this higher state of mind, where you can begin to shape your world through the power of imagination. When the verse asks, “Who has gone up to heaven, and come down?” it is pointing to the fact that <strong>you</strong> have the ability to enter this creative state and return with the manifestation of your desires.</p><p>The <strong>"I AM"</strong> is the answer here because it is the very awareness that allows you to shift from one state of mind (the physical, outer world) to another (the creative, imaginative realm). The <strong>I AM</strong> within you can ascend to heaven (the state of imagination) and return with the manifestation of those thoughts.</p><h3><strong>"Who Has Gathered the Wind in His Fists?"</strong></h3><p>The <strong>wind</strong> here is a symbol of the <strong>unseen forces</strong> of creation — thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions. These invisible forces are powerful, and <strong>the "I AM"</strong> is the power that directs them. To <strong>gather the wind in your fists</strong> is to take control of your thoughts and imagination, to <strong>direct these unseen forces towards the creation of your desired reality</strong>.</p><p>By repeatedly asking <strong>“who”</strong>, the verse directs you inward, to recognise that <strong>you</strong> are the one with the power to shape these forces. <strong>The answer is always "I AM"</strong> — the conscious awareness that holds dominion over thoughts, beliefs, and the imagination. The power to gather the wind — to control your thoughts and assumptions — lies within you.</p><h3><strong>"Who Has Bound the Waters in a Garment?"</strong></h3><p>Water represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> — the vast, often untapped reservoir of emotions, beliefs, and assumptions that influence our reality. To <strong>bind the waters in a garment</strong> is to bring order to the subconscious, to consciously direct your emotional energy and beliefs.</p><p>This task of binding the waters can only be accomplished by the <strong>"I AM"</strong> — the conscious self that brings awareness and control to the subconscious. The subconscious is like water — fluid and constantly moving — but when you consciously assume a desired state, you <strong>bind the waters</strong> and bring them into alignment with your imagination. The <strong>"I AM"</strong> is the consciousness that can consciously direct these emotional forces.</p><h3><strong>"Who Has Established All the Ends of the Earth?"</strong></h3><p>Finally, the <strong>"ends of the earth"</strong> represent the final manifestations of the creative process. This is the result of the <strong>"I AM"</strong> assuming and imagining a desired outcome, and then bringing it into the physical world. To <strong>establish all the ends of the earth</strong> means to bring your desires into physical reality.</p><p>Through the <strong>"I AM"</strong>, you are able to establish the world you desire. The earth, the tangible manifestation of your thoughts, is created by your <strong>assumptions</strong> and <strong>imaginings</strong>. Once again, the verse points to the fact that the power to create — to establish all things in your life — lies within you, in your <strong>"I AM"</strong> consciousness.</p><h3><strong>"What Is His Name, and What Is His Son's Name, If You Know?"</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s interpretation, the <strong>name</strong> represents the <strong>identity</strong> of the creator, and the <strong>son’s name</strong> represents the physical manifestation of that identity. The <strong>name of God</strong> is the <strong>"I AM"</strong> — the creative force within you. The <strong>son</strong> represents the <strong>manifestation</strong> of that creative power.</p><p>The <strong>"son’s name"</strong> is your desire made real — the <strong>physical expression</strong> of your imagination. When you ask, “What is his name, and what is his son’s name?” the answer is pointing to the <strong>"I AM"</strong> and the creative power of imagination, which gives birth to the <strong>son</strong> — the manifestation of your inner desires.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Repetition of "Who" and the Unveiling of the "I AM"</strong></h3><p>The repetition of the word <strong>"who"</strong> in Proverbs 30:4 serves as a powerful reminder: <strong>you are the creator</strong>, and the source of all creative power is within you. The <strong>"I AM"</strong> is the key to unlocking your ability to create the world you desire. Each question in the verse points to the fact that <strong>the power to create, to manifest, to shape reality, is within you</strong>.</p><p>When you ask "who," you are reminded to look inward and recognise that the <strong>"I AM"</strong> — your own consciousness — is the answer. It is the divine creative force that has the power to shape and manifest the world, to gather the unseen forces (the wind), to direct the subconscious (the waters), and to establish your desires in the physical world.</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, <strong>the repetition of "who" is not just a question, but a call to recognise the creative power within you</strong>. You are the "who." You are the <strong>"I AM"</strong>, and with this awareness, you hold the power to bring your imagination into reality.</p>
