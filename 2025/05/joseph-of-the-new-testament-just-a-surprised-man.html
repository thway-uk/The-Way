<h1>Joseph of the New Testament: Just a Surprised Man</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s symbolic reading, biblical characters are not historical figures but living symbols of states of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> and inner processes. Joseph, the husband of Mary in the New Testament, represents a stage in the spiritual journey — the moment when the rational mind beholds the mysterious working of imagination and assumption.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Joseph as the Rational Mind</h2>
<p>Joseph is described as <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">“a just man”</a> — a symbol of moral integrity, reason, and inner discipline. He stands for that part of us which wishes to do the right thing, protect appearances, and maintain order according to outer law.</p>
<p>When Joseph discovers that Mary is with child before they have come together, he is shocked. In the literal story, he considers divorcing her quietly to avoid public shame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.” — Matthew 1:19</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>The Symbolism of Mary’s Conception</h2>
<p>In Neville's teaching, <strong>Mary represents the subconscious mind</strong>, the receptive aspect of us that accepts impressions and brings them to life. The “Holy Spirit” or divine seed is the creative power of imagination, which operates beyond logic and physical means.</p>
<p>Joseph's surprise at Mary’s conception reflects the rational mind’s inability to comprehend how a new state or desire can take shape without physical interaction or outer evidence. The subconscious (Mary) accepts the assumption (seed) and begins to express it, even when the conscious, reasoning mind (Joseph) does not understand how.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Quiet Divorce: The End of Outer Reason</h2>
<p>Joseph’s impulse to “divorce her quietly” symbolises the rational mind’s moment of withdrawal when faced with an inner creation it cannot explain. Rather than fight or shame the subconscious, Joseph chooses not to expose or interfere — he respects the process, even if he does not fully grasp it.</p>
<p>This moment highlights an important step in manifestation: the shift from reason to faith in imagination. When the conscious mind steps back and ceases to question “how,” it allows the subconscious to carry the assumption to term.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Angel: Higher Intuition</h2>
<p>An angel appears to Joseph in a dream, telling him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.” — Matthew 1:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the moment when intuition, or higher knowing, reassures the rational mind. Joseph realises that what has been conceived is holy — a new state of being or identity arising from the creative power within.</p>
<p>He learns that his role is not to reason or interfere, but to support and protect this new life until it comes fully into the world.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Joseph’s New Role: Guardian of the Inner Child</h2>
<p>After accepting the message, Joseph becomes the guardian of Mary and the unborn child. Symbolically, he shifts from doubter to protector of the new assumption.</p>
<p>This is the moment when the conscious mind aligns itself with the subconscious creation and begins to nourish and defend it rather than question it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Joseph in the New Testament embodies the rational mind’s transformation in the spiritual process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initially surprised</strong> by the miraculous conception (the sudden appearance of a new assumption or state).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Willing to step aside</strong>, symbolised by the decision to divorce quietly, showing the surrender of reasoning when faced with inner truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reassured by intuition</strong>, learning that what is born within is divine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Becomes protector</strong>, aligning with and safeguarding the new inner life until it manifests fully.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Key Point</h3>
<p>The story of Joseph reminds us that when imagination (the Holy Spirit) plants a seed in the subconscious (Mary), the rational mind (Joseph) must learn to trust and support rather than interfere. In this, we see the essence of the law of assumption: what we accept as true inwardly, regardless of outer reason, will inevitably be born into our world.</p>
