<h1>The Language of Desire: Biblical Kisses as Manifestation in Action</h1>
<p></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</span></p><p>
— Song of Solomon 1:2</p></blockquote><p></p><p>In the Song of Solomon, the kiss is a powerful metaphor for imagination meeting reality. It is not about physical kissing, but a sacred symbol of the intimate union where desire becomes fulfilled, and love—manifested imagination—is expressed and lived. Each biblical kiss referenced in Scripture reflects a moment of this creative union: the inward vision embracing and becoming the outward experience.</p><p><strong>The mouth is the mouthpiece of imagination and manifested reality.</strong><br />
It is through the mouth that the creative word is spoken — the imagination’s vision is declared and made real. When the kisses fall “of the mouth,” it symbolises the spoken creative power meeting the felt reality, the dream being voiced and embraced in the living moment.</p><p><strong>These kisses are metaphorical expressions, capturing the deep emotional and spiritual union between the imagined desire and its manifestation.</strong><br />
The sensory feelings evoked—the weeping, the touching, the kisses—are the very language of desire in action. Neville taught that feeling is the secret; it is the emotional reality that breathes life into imagination. The tears, embraces, and kisses recorded in Scripture are not literal but symbolic gestures expressing longing fulfilled. They capture the union happening fully in the moment—the realisation of vision meeting reality, the heart fully engaged in the creative act.</p><hr /><p><strong>Joseph and Benjamin — Reunion of Inner Truths</strong></p><p>“And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.”<br />
— Genesis 45:14</p><p>This kiss on the neck expresses the deep emotional awakening when imagination’s vision (Joseph) is finally embraced by the feeling self (Benjamin). It echoes the Song’s idea of the beloved’s kiss as sweeter than wine—imagination’s joyful manifestation meeting reality’s readiness to receive.</p><hr /><p><strong>Jacob and Esau — Reconciliation and Acceptance</strong></p><p>“And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.”<br />
— Genesis 33:4</p><p>Here, the kiss is the acceptance of a new state of being, mirroring the Song’s yearning for intimate union. Esau’s embrace and kiss show the outer self opening to the inner creative vision, allowing the long-sought harmony to be felt and expressed.</p><hr /><p><strong>The Prodigal Son — The Return to Love</strong></p><p>“And he arose, and came to his father… and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”<br />
— Luke 15:20</p><p>The father’s kiss is the ultimate welcoming of imagination’s return—when the lost vision (the son) is restored and made real. This is the Song’s kiss fulfilled: love that restores and overflows, sweeter than any worldly delight.</p><hr /><p><strong>Ruth and Naomi — Choosing Love’s Path</strong></p><p>“And Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.”<br />
— Ruth 1:14</p><p>Orpah’s kiss is a farewell; Ruth’s clinging is persistence in love and faith. The kiss here symbolizes the choice to embrace the imagined promise despite hardship, reflecting the Song’s deep desire for union that transcends temporary separation.</p><hr /><p><strong>David and Jonathan — The Covenant of the Heart</strong></p><p>“And they kissed one another, and wept one with another.”<br />
— 1 Samuel 20:41</p><p>David and Jonathan’s kiss represents the sacred bond of shared vision and mutual support. The weeping kiss aligns with the Song’s theme: longing fulfilled through emotional union, where imagination’s promise is sealed in the reality of brotherly love.</p><hr /><p><strong>Judas and Jesus — Revelation through the Kiss</strong></p><p>“But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?”<br />
— Luke 22:48</p><p>Judas’ kiss, often seen as betrayal, can also be understood as a revealing union where the internal recognition of Jesus as the Righteous One (reflecting Judah’s legacy) is made manifest. The kiss exposes the intimate meeting of imagination (Jesus as the fulfilled vision) and the outer self (Judas revealing this truth). It is the Song’s kiss of revelation, where desire meets manifestation, though complicated by human misunderstanding.</p><hr /><p><strong>Living in the End: The Heart of the Kiss</strong></p><p>The kisses in these biblical moments echo Neville Goddard’s core teaching of <em>living in the end</em>. Each kiss symbolises the union where imagination (the end state) is fully felt and accepted as present reality. This living-as-if—the belief and emotional embracing of the fulfilled desire—is the very “kiss” that transforms vision into manifestation. Just as the beloved invites “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,” so too does <em>living in the end</em> invite us to embody the fulfilled state, allowing imagination and reality to meet in love’s perfect union.</p><hr /><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Every biblical kiss echoes the longing and fulfilment described in the Song of Solomon. They symbolise the sacred meeting of imagination and reality—the inner beloved and the outer lover embracing in manifestation.</p><p>Through these metaphorical kisses, the Bible shows us how manifestation is not a distant event but an intimate union of desire, feeling, and reality. The kisses teach us that imagination’s creative power is fulfilled when the soul welcomes it fully, just as the Song of Solomon invites us: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy love is better than wine."</p>
