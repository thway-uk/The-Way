MacGregor Mathers. This table associates each of the 22 Hebrew letters with specific symbolic meanings, numerical values, and phonetic sounds. Through this framework, the Hebrew alphabet serves as a spiritual map, offering insights into the nature of creation, consciousness, and the divine process.<p></p><p>In this article, we will explore the Mathers Table, translating its symbolic meanings into Neville Goddard’s spiritual framework, particularly focusing on how these letters align with principles of manifestation, imagination, and self-transformation.</p><hr /><h2>Understanding Key Hebrew Letters and Their Symbolism</h2><h3>Aleph (א) — 1</h3><p><strong>Divine</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Unity, breath of life.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Aleph represents the primordial “I AM,” pure consciousness before form. It’s the silent awareness, the One Life flowing through all. Manifestation begins here—the knowing “I exist,” the seed of all creation. When you imagine, you connect with this infinite source.</p><hr /><h3>Bet (ב) — 2</h3><p><strong>House</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Dwelling place, container.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Bet is the mind, the inner “house” where the seed of imagination is planted. Your mind is the fertile ground in which your imagined desires grow. Bet signals the start of duality—subject and object—and the internal creative process.</p><hr /><h3>Gimel (ג) — 3</h3><p><strong>Camel</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Movement, reward.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Gimel symbolizes motion toward your goals and the giving of what you receive. It urges you to move forward, confident that the subconscious will reward your persistence.</p><hr /><h3>Daled (ד) — 4</h3><p><strong>Door</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Entryway, opportunity.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> The “door” represents the threshold between the outer world and inner imagination. To manifest, you must cross this door — shift your consciousness inward. Daled invites you to open this portal through faith and belief.</p><hr /><h3>He (ה) — 5</h3><p><strong>Window</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Revelation, breath.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> He represents divine inspiration and the breath of life entering your consciousness. It is the opening that allows new ideas to come in through imagination — the creative spirit breathing life into your mental images.</p><hr /><h3>Vav (ו) — 6</h3><p><strong>Nail</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Connection, fastening.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Vav fixes your imagined scene into the subconscious mind. It’s the connection point where mental state becomes reality — akin to the crucifixion of an idea, fixing it in place until it manifests.</p><hr /><h3>Zayin (ז) — 7</h3><p><strong>Sword</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Spiritual power, cutting away.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Zayin represents the spiritual sword used to cut away doubts and limiting beliefs, clearing the mind to hold only the truth of your imagined state.</p><hr /><h3>Chet (ח) — 8</h3><p><strong>Fence</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Enclosure, life force.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Chet symbolizes protection and the boundaries you create around imagination. It is the sacred space nurturing your vision until it grows without interference.</p><hr /><h3>Tet (ט) — 9</h3><p><strong>Serpent</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Hidden good, potential.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Tet embodies hidden power and transformative energy. It represents the inner alchemy turning ordinary thoughts into extraordinary realities.</p><hr /><h3>Yod (י) — 10</h3><p><strong>Hand</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Point of creation, action.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Yod is the conscious action of imagination, the “hand” that shapes reality. It emphasises manifestation as a deliberate creative act.</p><hr /><h3>Kaf (כ) — 20</h3><p><strong>Palm</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Power, potential.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Kaf stands for the power of choice and the capacity to shape your destiny. It is the willingness to grasp your imagined state with faith and persistence.</p><hr /><h3>Lamed (ל) — 30</h3><p><strong>Goad</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Aspiration, teaching.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Lamed is the driving force of spiritual growth, urging you to stay aligned with imagination despite appearances.</p><hr /><h3>Mem (מ) — 40</h3><p><strong>Water</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Life flow, nurturing.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Mem reminds you that manifestation is fluid and abundant. It symbolises the subconscious mind’s receptivity to imaginative acts.</p><hr /><h3>Nun (נ) — 50</h3><p><strong>Fish</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Faith, life force.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Nun embodies faith and spiritual endurance — holding your imagined scene despite outer evidence.</p><hr /><h3>Samekh (ס) — 60</h3><p><strong>Prop</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Support, circle.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Samekh represents divine support and inner assurance that your imagination is upheld by universal creative power.</p><hr /><h3>Ayin (ע) — 70</h3><p><strong>Eye</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Insight, perception.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Ayin is spiritual insight — the inner eye that perceives the reality of your imagined state as already fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3>Pe (פ) — 80</h3><p><strong>Mouth</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Speech, expression.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Pe is the power of words to shape reality. It signifies how affirmations and self-talk broadcast your inner state to the subconscious.</p><hr /><h3>Tsade (צ) — 90</h3><p><strong>Hook</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Catch, righteousness.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Tsade draws your desires from the subconscious into manifestation, representing alignment with your true inner vision.</p><hr /><h3>Qof (ק) — 100</h3><p><strong>Back of head</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Subconscious, transformation.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Qof signifies the hidden realm where imagined states incubate and shape your outer world.</p><hr /><h3>Resh (ר) — 200</h3><p><strong>Head</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Beginning, leadership.<br />
<strong>Neville Goddard Meaning:</strong> Resh represents new conscious awareness and leadership of your inner world, signaling the birth of new ideas.</p><hr /><h3>Shin (ש) — 300</h3><p><strong>Tooth</strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Fire, divine power.<br />
