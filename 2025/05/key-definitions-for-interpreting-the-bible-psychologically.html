<h1>Key Definitions for Interpreting the Bible Psychologically</h1>
<p><strong>This is an initial list to assist a reader in the foundational picturing of symbolism.</strong></p><p><strong>God is your “I AM” — seated in imagination.</strong><br />
<em>(Exodus 3:14)</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 1:2</strong> — “The Spirit of God hovered over the waters”<br />
<em>Spirit (consciousness) and soul (subconscious) unite in creative stillness.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 1:11</strong> — “The seed is in itself”<br />
<em>Creation begins within imagination — what you assume bears fruit.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 1:26</strong> — “Let Us make man in Our image”<br />
<em>Imagination is conscious and subconscious joined. “Man” is who you are aware of being, your perception of self, not a physical man.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 2:23</strong> — “Bone of my bones”<br />
<em>Life and form emanate from imagination — the outer drawn from the inner.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 2:24</strong><br />
<em>Begins the symbolic journey of love and union in imagination.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Genesis 4:7</strong> — “Sin is crouching at the door… but you must master it.”<br />
<em>Sin = failure to imagine lovingly. Choose honour, not fear.</em></p><hr /><p>
