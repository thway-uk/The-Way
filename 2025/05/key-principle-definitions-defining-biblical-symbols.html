<h1>Key Principle Definitions: Defining Biblical Symbols</h1>
<p>This is an initial set of symbols to help the reader begin interpreting the Bible through the power of imagination:</p><p><strong>Genesis 1:2</strong><br />
<em>“The Spirit of God hovered over the waters”</em><br />
Spirit and soul unite — stillness before movement, potential before creation.</p><p><strong>Genesis 1:11</strong><br />
<em>“Seed in itself”</em><br />
Creation begins within. The seed of every experience is planted in imagination.</p><p><strong>Genesis 1:26</strong><br />
<em>“God said, Let Us make man in Our image”</em><br />
Imagination is the union of conscious and subconscious. "Man" refers to your self-concept — who you are aware of being — not a physical form.</p><p><strong>Genesis 2:23</strong><br />
<em>“Bone of my bones”</em><br />
The outer is born of the inner. Life emanates from imagination.</p><p><strong>Genesis 2:24</strong><br />
<em>“Cleave to his wife”</em><br />
This reflects the pursuit of love and union within imagination — the fusion of desire and fulfilment.</p><p><strong>Genesis 4:7</strong><br />
<em>“If you do well, will you not have honour? And if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master.”</em><br />
Sin is the failure to imagine delightfully and lovingly. It is not moral failure, but misalignment with creative intent.</p><p><strong>Exodus 3:14</strong><br />
<em>“I AM THAT WHICH I AM”</em><br />
God is your “I AM” — the awareness of being — seated in imagination.</p>
