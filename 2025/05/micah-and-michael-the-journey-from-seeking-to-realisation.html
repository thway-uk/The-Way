<h1>Micah and Michael: The Journey from Seeking to Realisation</h1>
<p>In the Bible, the names <strong>Micah</strong> and <strong>Michael</strong> both ask the same question: <em>“Who is like God?”</em> Yet, they represent two stages of spiritual awakening—<strong>Micah</strong> as the seeking soul and <strong>Michael</strong> as the realised divine self. By examining these names through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we uncover a deeper understanding of how the journey from questioning to realisation mirrors our own path to manifesting our desires through the creative power of imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Micah: The Seeker of Divinity</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.”</em><br />
— Judges 17:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>Judges 17</strong>, we are introduced to a man named <strong>Micah</strong>, from the tribe of Ephraim, who starts his journey in search of divine connection. The name <em>Micah</em> (מִיכָה, <em>Mikha</em>) comes from <strong>Micaiah</strong> (מִיכָיָה), meaning <em>“Who is like Yah?”</em> or <em>“Who is like the Lord?”</em> This question reflects the soul’s yearning for divinity. In Neville Goddard’s framework, <strong>Micah</strong> symbolises the part of us that <strong>seeks</strong> spiritual truth, wondering how we can ever be like God. This search is the beginning of our spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Micah represents the awareness that God is not external, but something we long to connect with within ourselves. However, Micah’s actions—such as making idols for worship and seeking a Levite priest—indicate that he’s still seeking external expressions of God, reflecting the stage of <strong>spiritual seeking</strong> that many of us experience before realising our divine power is within.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard's teachings, this reflects the journey of <strong>awakening to imagination</strong>—recognising that we are the creators of our world and that we must shift our focus from external searches to the inner power of our imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Michael: The Defender of the Assumption</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon…”</em><br />
— Revelation 12:7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name <em>Michael</em> (מִיכָאֵל, <em>Mikha'el</em>) means <strong>“Who is like God?”</strong>, but this time, with the understanding that God, or <em>El</em>, is within us. <strong>Michael</strong>, the archangel, represents <strong>higher awareness</strong> and divine protection.</p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <strong>Michael</strong> symbolises the <em>fully realised consciousness</em>—the divine self that knows it is one with God. But more importantly, Michael is also the <strong>defender of the assumption</strong>, the inner protector that holds the vision or belief until it manifests. When we assume the feeling of our wish fulfilled, Michael ensures that our assumption remains steadfast, protecting it from doubt, external distractions, and the forces that might cause us to waver.</p>
<p>Michael stands firm in the face of contradictions, embodying the <strong>strength to persist</strong> in the belief that our assumption is the truth, despite external appearances. He guards and sustains our vision, ensuring that it will manifest according to the creative power of our imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Path from Micah to Michael: Realising Our Divine Power</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Micah</strong> and <strong>Michael</strong> represent two distinct stages in the spiritual journey: the seeker and the realised divine self. <strong>Micah</strong> asks, <em>“Who is like God?”</em>, unaware that the answer lies within. <strong>Michael</strong>, however, is the answer—the embodiment of divine knowing and the protector of our assumptions.</p>
<p>In practical terms, when we begin with Micah's question, we are engaging in the <strong>process of awakening</strong> to the power of imagination within. As we realise the truth of our nature, we step into <strong>Michael's role</strong>, protecting our assumptions with the full force of our creative consciousness.</p>
<p>By defending our assumptions, we become the <strong>defender of our own reality</strong>, ensuring that our desires manifest in alignment with the <strong>divine power</strong> within us.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Embracing the Journey from Micah to Michael</strong></h2>
<p>The journey from <strong>Micah to Michael</strong> is the journey of <strong>spiritual realisation</strong> and manifestation. It is the movement from questioning <em>Who is like God?</em> to realising that <strong>I AM</strong> the creator of my own world. Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we understand that the divine power to shape our reality lies within our imagination. Like Michael, we must protect our assumptions, stand firm in our beliefs, and persist until our desires come into being.</p>
<p>The path from Micah to Michael is not just about seeking God externally but recognising that <strong>we are God in expression</strong>—through imagination, persistence, and the assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p>
