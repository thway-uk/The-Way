<h1>Leviticus 19 and the Law of Assumption: Inner Commandments for the Creative Life</h1>
<p>To the literal reader, Leviticus 19 may appear as a list of ancient laws, full of ritual restrictions and behavioural codes. But for those who follow Neville Goddard’s teaching—that <em>“the Bible is not history but a psychological drama”</em>—this chapter becomes a powerful manual for inner transformation. Through the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, every verse is a call to awaken, assume noble states, and create from the divine centre: <em>I AM</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.” (Leviticus 19:2)</strong></h2>
<p>To be “holy” is not about moral perfection. It is to be <strong>set apart in consciousness</strong>—to align with the nature of God, which Neville identified as <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. Holiness is the discipline of living from the <strong>end state</strong> of what you desire, assuming its truth even before it is seen. As He is, so are you.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Honouring Your Origins: “Respect your father and mother” (Leviticus 19:3)</strong></h2>
<p>Your “father and mother” symbolise <strong>your foundational assumptions</strong>—the beliefs and emotional atmospheres that gave birth to your current experience. To honour them is to recognise their role, but not to remain bound by them. You may respect the soil from which you grew, but <strong>you are free to assume a new seed of identity</strong> at any moment.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Idols and Metal Gods: Do Not Externalise Power (Leviticus 19:4)</strong></h2>
<p>Idols are images of <strong>external power</strong>. Metal gods are rigid, man-made beliefs. Neville insisted: <em>“The only God is your own consciousness.”</em> To turn to idols is to hand your creative power to appearances, conditions, or other people. The Law of Assumption demands that you return power to its true source—<strong>yourself</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Edges of the Field: Leave Space for Grace (Leviticus 19:9–10)</strong></h2>
<p>“You shall not reap your field to its very edges.” Symbolically, this instructs you to <strong>leave margin in your life and mind</strong>. Don’t harvest every part of your imagination with anxiety or control. Leave room for the unexpected, for divine movement, for others to partake in your abundance. <strong>Assumption is not force; it is faithful, generous openness.</strong></p>
<p>The story of <strong>Ruth</strong>, who gleaned from the leftover grain in Boaz’s field, perfectly illustrates this principle. Ruth enters a new state—one of quiet trust—and her entire destiny shifts through what others left behind. What looks like residue is often the <strong>space where favour enters</strong>. When you leave the edges unharvested, you allow grace to work in ways you could never predict or plan.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Do Not Lie, Steal, or Deceive (Leviticus 19:11)</strong></h2>
<p>To deceive is to act from <strong>a state not truly assumed</strong>—to operate from lack or desperation. In Neville’s language, <em>“you cannot pretend a state; you must enter it.”</em> To steal is to assume separation and scarcity. But to <em>be</em> the thing hoped for, to walk in its fulfilment, is the only true honesty in the spiritual sense.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Love your neighbour as yourself.” (Leviticus 19:18)</strong></h2>
<p>Your neighbour is <strong>your reflected self</strong>. Every person you meet, every situation you face, arises from states you have accepted within. To love your neighbour is to <strong>love the state they reflect back to you</strong>, and if it is unlovely, to revise it lovingly in imagination. It is a command to see others as already redeemed—because you have chosen to dwell in that truth.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Do Not Cut Your Bodies for the Dead or Tattoo Yourselves (Leviticus 19:28)</strong></h2>
<p>This verse is deeply symbolic: <strong>cutting yourself for the dead</strong> means <em>suffering for a state that no longer lives within you</em>. “The dead” are your <strong>past identities</strong>, and every time you rehearse your failures, replay the pain, or wear labels that no longer serve you, you are cutting yourself on their grave.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the man called <strong>Legion</strong> lived among the tombs, cutting himself with stones (Mark 5:5). This is the perfect image of <strong>someone possessed by many old states</strong>, many assumptions, and unable to break free. But once he encountered awareness of truth (symbolised by Jesus), he was clothed, calm, and in his right mind. To stop “cutting” is to stop <strong>re-identifying with what no longer serves you</strong>, and instead assume the healing, unified state of “I AM.”</p>
<p>Likewise, <strong>tattoos</strong> symbolise permanent markings—self-concepts etched onto the imagination. Leviticus is urging us: <strong>do not make permanent what should be passing</strong>. You are not your trauma, your history, your former limitations. The Law of Assumption is the permission to be reborn in consciousness.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Conclusion: A Holy Life is a Creative Life</strong></h2>
<p>Leviticus 19, viewed through Neville Goddard’s teaching, becomes not a demand for ritual obedience, but an invitation to <em>creative mastery</em>. It teaches us to guard our thoughts, honour our assumptions, and live consciously from the state we wish to see expressed. The real holiness is not moral superiority—it is the disciplined use of <strong>imagination aligned with love</strong>.</p>
<p>Live from your chosen state. That is the fulfilment of every law.</p>
