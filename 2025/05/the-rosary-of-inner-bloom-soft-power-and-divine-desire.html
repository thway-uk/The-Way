<h1>The Rosary of Inner Bloom: Soft Power and Divine Desire</h1>
<p><em>A Neville Goddard-Inspired Devotional in Soft Power and Divine Desire</em></p>
<p>This is not a prayer of striving. It is a gentle return to what already is.<br />
It is the slow flowering of your heart’s desire,<br />
curated to embody softness, receptivity, and the quiet confidence of assumption.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Opening Invocation: The Divine Whisper of Identity</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“My loved one is mine, and I am his.” — Song of Songs 2:16</strong><br />
Begin here: in belovedness.<br />
All movement begins in union, not in distance.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>First Bead: Open to Receive</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“Let your request be made known to God.” — Philippians 4:6</strong><br />
Desire is not a flaw. It is the holy spark.<br />
You may ask—and trust.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Next Three Beads: The Gentle Renewal of Mind</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“</strong><b>Take your rest in the Lord, waiting quietly for him</b><strong>” — Psalm 37:7</strong><br />
Waiting is not weakness. It is sacred magnetism.</p>
<p><strong>“I will make her come into the waste land and say words of comfort to her heart.” — Hosea 2:14</strong><br />
Even in barrenness, he speaks comfort.</p>
<p><strong>“The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand.” — Psalm 121:5</strong><br />
You are protected, always—even from the heat of your own doubts.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Before the Decades: Establish the Inner Garden</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“The smell of your sweet perfumes is better than all spices.” — Song of Songs 4:10</strong><br />
You are already fragrant with promise.<br />
You do not need to bloom to be beautiful.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Five Decades: Petals of Fulfilled Desire</strong></h2>
<p>Each decade begins with a <strong>Desire Declaration</strong>, followed by a <strong>Petal Verse</strong> to be softly repeated ten times.<br />
This is the rhythm of faith—not effort, but expectancy.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>1. I Am Heard and Held</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Desire Declaration:</strong><br />
<em>“You will make your prayer to him, and he will give ear to you; and you will give effect to your oaths.” — Job 22:27</em></p>

<hr />

<hr />
<h3><strong>5. I Am the Desired Fulfilment</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Petal Verse (repeat 10 times):</strong><br />
<em>“And they will give him the name Immanuel; which is, God with us.” — Matthew 1:23</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Closing Benediction: Return to Stillness, Rooted in Promise</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“In peace I will take my rest and sleep; for you only, Lord, keep me safe.” — Psalm 4:8</strong><br />
<strong>“The Lord will give strength to his people; the Lord will give his people the blessing of peace.” — Psalm 29:11</strong><br />
<strong>“You will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is fixed on you.” — Isaiah 26:3</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Feel the petals closing. The fragrance lingers.<br />
Your desire is heard.<br />
Your heart is the sacred ground.</p>
