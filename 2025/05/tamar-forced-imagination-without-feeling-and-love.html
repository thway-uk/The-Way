Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not secular history but a psychological drama happening within us. The “I AM” — our core awareness — moves through different states. When a state is entered with love and faith, imagination brings it to life. When forced, it causes inner conflict.</p>
<p>The story of Tamar, Amnon, and Absalom (2 Samuel 13), when compared to the longing in the Song of Solomon, shows that assumption can either become a sacred union or a violation, depending on whether imagination is honoured or abused.</p>
<h3>Tamar: Receptive Imagination</h3>
<p>Tamar (meaning “palm tree”) represents the receptive, fertile state of imagination. In Song of Solomon, this openness is celebrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love.” — Song of Solomon 2:5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is desire that trusts and waits, not forced but assumed in love.</p>
<h3>Amnon: The Forcing Aspect of Mind</h3>
<p>Amnon represents the “I AM” that tries to take by force rather than from love and feeling within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Amnon said to the king, ‘Let Tamar come and make me cakes so I may eat from her hand.’” — 2 Samuel 13:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Symbolically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feigning illness = a false state, a fake assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In my sight” = needing external proof before belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eating from her hand = trying to seize from imagination without truly feeling it as real.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amnon does not try to feel or enter the state of imagination genuinely; instead, he attempts to force the result, wanting manifestation without becoming it. As Neville said, “To force a desire is to confess it is not real.”</p>
<h3>The Torn Garment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe of many colours...” — 2 Samuel 13:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/2025/05/sackcloth-and-ashes-state-that-feels.html">Tamar’s robe symbolises</a> imagination’s rich potential. When the ego forces instead of lovingly assuming, imagination is “torn” — the result is pain and inner fragmentation.</p>
<h3>Absalom: The Mind’s Correcting Aspect</h3>
<p>Absalom symbolises an aspect of the mind — the part that notices when the ego (Amnon) forces desire instead of honouring it. This aspect holds awareness of the wrong and quietly remembers the violation until it acts to restore balance.</p>
<p>You cannot deceive this part of the subconscious for long. What is forced without faith eventually collapses.</p>
<h3>Final Summary: Honour, Don’t Force</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamar</strong>: Pure, receptive imagination — “I AM ready.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amnon</strong>: The impatient ego — “I want now, but I won’t become.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absalom</strong>: The mind’s correcting force — aware, remembering, restoring balance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: How Do You Assume?</strong></p>
<p>Neville taught that assumption is creation. But it must be honest, felt, and done with love. You can’t trick your imagination.</p>
<p>If you feel the need to “grab” or force, you are acting as Amnon. Return instead to Tamar’s state: “I AM willing. I AM receptive. I AM one with my desire.”</p>
<p>As Neville said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dare to assume you are what you want to be, and you will compel the world to reflect it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you force, the garment tears — and so do you.</p>
