<h1>Hebrews 1: Neville Style Passage Analysis</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard's interpretation, Hebrews 1 can be understood as a powerful demonstration of the law of assumption, which suggests that our assumptions and beliefs shape our reality. The chapter begins by highlighting the supremacy of the Son (Jesus), showing how the "Son" is a reflection of the highest state of consciousness, or the highest form of imagination.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"God, who at various times and in different ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son" (Hebrews 1:1-2).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, Neville would interpret "God" as the consciousness within us, and "His Son" as the highest form of imagination or assumption. The shift from "prophets" to "Son" signifies a movement from external revelations to the internal, personal realization of imagination as the creative force. In Neville's view, this indicates the shift from relying on external prophets to understanding that God speaks to us directly through the power of imagination and assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds" (Hebrews 1:2).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neville would see this as an affirmation that imagination (the "Son") is the heir to all things. The worlds (or the realities we experience) are created through imagination. The assumption of what we believe or imagine becomes the blueprint for our world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power" (Hebrews 1:3).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "Son" as the "express image" of God's person implies that imagination mirrors the divine nature. Just as light is the visible manifestation of energy, our assumptions (imagination) reflect the nature of our inner world. The law of assumption suggests that by imagining a desired state as true, we can bring it into our reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"When He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high" (Hebrews 1:3).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neville would interpret the idea of "purging sins" as the cleansing of incorrect assumptions or beliefs. "Sitting at the right hand of the Majesty" suggests being in alignment with the highest state of consciousness, implying that when we purify our assumptions and beliefs, we sit in the place of powerâ€”fully in control of our reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they" (Hebrews 1:4).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The "angels" in Neville's teachings represent different aspects of our subconscious mind, so being "better than the angels" means that our imagination (Son) is supreme. The "more excellent name" indicates that by assuming the highest states of consciousness, we transcend lower states of being, such as doubt, fear, and limitation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Let all the angels of God worship Him" (Hebrews 1:6).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neville would explain this as the mind being in total alignment with the assumption of your ideal state. The "angels" (the various aspects of your subconscious mind) align with and support the assumption that you have made, worshipping your inner command of imagination and belief.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, Hebrews 1, interpreted through Neville Goddard's teachings, reveals that the power of imagination (the Son) is the key to shaping our reality. By assuming the state of being that we desire to experience, we align ourselves with the divine creative power and the "word" (our assumptions) that shapes our world. The chapter encourages the reader to embrace their role as the creator of their own reality by assuming the desired state as if it is already true.</p>
