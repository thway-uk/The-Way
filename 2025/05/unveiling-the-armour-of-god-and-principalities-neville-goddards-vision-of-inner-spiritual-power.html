<h1>Unveiling the Armour of God and Principalities: Neville Goddard’s Vision of Inner Spiritual Power</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard was a visionary teacher who revealed the Bible as a profound guide to our inner world, not a historical literal text. He taught that the stories, characters, and symbols in the Bible are actually reflections of our psychological states—maps of imagination and consciousness.</p><p>Rather than seeing miracles as external events, Neville showed us that the real power lies within our own imagination. The Bible’s language is symbolic, describing how our thoughts and beliefs shape the reality we experience.</p><p>With this fresh understanding, we see spiritual growth as an inward journey. The Bible’s teachings become tools to transform our inner states and unlock our creative power.</p><p>One of the Bible’s most vivid metaphors—the <strong>Full Armour of God</strong>—beautifully illustrates this inner spiritual readiness. Let’s explore Neville’s interpretation and discover the power that each piece of this armour represents within us.</p><hr /><h3>The Full Armour of God: Neville Goddard’s Vision of Inner Spiritual Power</h3><p>The Apostle Paul’s famous passage in <strong>Ephesians 6:10-18</strong> speaks of the “full armour of God” as a defence against spiritual challenges. But what if this armour isn’t a literal set of metal pieces, but a profound metaphor for something far deeper? Neville Goddard, the great teacher of imagination and consciousness, invites us to see this armour as a vivid symbol of our inner spiritual preparedness — a readiness rooted in imagination and faith.</p><p>Let’s explore each piece of this armour through Neville’s transformative understanding and uncover the power we each hold within.</p><hr /><p><strong>Ephesians 6:10-18 (NIV)</strong><br />
“Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.<br />
Therefore put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.<br />
Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.<br />
In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.<br />
Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br />
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.”</p><hr /><h3>Understanding “Principalities,” “Powers,” and “Rulers” in Neville’s Terms</h3><p>Before we unpack the armour itself, it’s important to clarify the “enemy” Paul describes—the forces against which we must stand. Neville teaches that these are not literal external beings but represent inner psychological and spiritual states.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Principalities, Powers, Rulers of Darkness, Spiritual Forces of Evil</strong> are symbolic of the subconscious beliefs, fears, doubts, and conditioned thought patterns that oppose the awakening and creative power of your imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are the “dark” influences within the mind—old stories, limiting convictions, and emotional resistance that keep you stuck in unwanted reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your struggle is not external but an inward battle to overcome these limiting inner authorities by aligning with your true, imaginative self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The armour is your spiritual equipment to protect you from falling prey to these mental “attacks” and to maintain your conscious creation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In other words, these “forces” represent the internal enemies of transformation and faith—resistance to change, disbelief, fear, and the conditioning of the subconscious mind.</p><hr /><h3>The Belt of Truth: The Foundation of Your Reality</h3><p>Paul instructs us to buckle the belt of truth around our waist. Neville teaches that truth is the reality you choose to live in — the “I AM” awareness you hold in your imagination. Just as a belt secures and supports armour, truth holds your spiritual identity firm.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
To wear the belt of truth is to fully accept your imagined reality as absolute. You do not waver between doubt and belief; you live as if your inner vision is the only reality that matters.</p><hr /><h3>The Breastplate of Righteousness: Guarding the Heart with Assumption</h3><p>The breastplate protects vital organs — your core being. For Neville, righteousness means assuming the feeling of the fulfilled wish, living as though your desires are already realised.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
Righteousness is the steadfast assumption of “rightness,” a shield for your heart against fear and disbelief. You embody your desires now, making your imagination your fortress.</p><hr /><h3>The Shoes of the Gospel of Peace: Walking Steadily in Belief</h3><p>Fitting your feet with the readiness from the gospel of peace means walking on a calm, confident foundation. Neville shows peace as the assurance beneath your steps in the imaginative path.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
Grounded in the knowledge that imagination creates reality, you move steadily through challenges, undisturbed by outer chaos. Peace is your sure footing.</p><hr /><h3>The Shield of Faith: Deflecting Doubt and Negativity</h3><p>The shield of faith can quench all flaming darts of the adversary. Neville’s interpretation is faith as the creative force — unwavering trust in the unseen reality you imagine.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
Faith is active imagination that protects you from fears and doubts. It deflects anything that would weaken your creative power.</p><hr /><h3>The Helmet of Salvation: Guarding the Mind with Awareness</h3><p>The helmet guards the head — the seat of thought. Salvation, for Neville, is mental renewal, awakening from limiting beliefs to your true divine nature.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
Wearing the helmet means constantly remembering who you truly are: the I AM, the creative spirit. This awareness shields your mind from confusion and negativity.</p><hr /><h3>The Sword of the Spirit: The Creative Word of Imagination</h3><p>The sword, the word of God, is your active creative power. Neville teaches that this word is the imaginative act — feeling and conviction of your wish fulfilled, silently spoken within.</p><p><strong>Inner Meaning:</strong><br />
Your imagination is the sword that cuts through obstacles and manifests desires. It is your weapon, wielded with faith and clarity.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Armour as Your Inner Spiritual Reality</h3><p>Paul’s full armour is not physical gear but states of consciousness to embody as creators of reality. Neville Goddard reveals these as truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and imagination — forming an invincible spiritual force within.</p><p>Putting on this armour means standing firm not against flesh and blood, but against limiting thoughts and beliefs. You become master of your inner kingdom, manifesting your desires through the power of your imagination.</p>
