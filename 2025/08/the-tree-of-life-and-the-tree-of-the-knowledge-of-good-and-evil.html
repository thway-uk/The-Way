<body><h1>The Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h1><p></p><p></p><blockquote>"And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so."— Genesis 1:11</blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>“The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. <strong>In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</strong>” — Genesis 2:9 (NIV)</p><p></p></blockquote><p>In the symbolic language of Scripture, the two trees in the Garden—<strong>the Tree of Life</strong> and <strong>the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</strong>—are not physical trees, but patterns of consciousness. One reveals the unified perception of Life through assumption; the other, the fragmented path of duality through judgment. These are not distant relics of Eden, but ever-present <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>structures within the mind</b></a>.</p><h2><strong>The Tree of Life: Assumption and Unity</strong></h2><p>The Tree of Life represents the way of <b><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">inner union</a></b>. It is the state in which one <em>assumes</em> what one desires to be true and lives from that <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">inner conviction</a>. This is the tree of assumption—the creative principle Neville Goddard taught as the foundation of manifestation:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</p>
</blockquote><p>To eat of this tree is to live in the awareness of “<b><a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></b>,” unshaken by appearances, choosing to identify with the end rather than the process. It is consciousness fixed in love, not fear.</p><h2><strong>The Tree of Knowledge: Judgment and Division</strong></h2><p>The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil symbolises the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>judging mind</b></a>—ever weighing, dividing, and comparing. It is the path of self-analysis, condemnation, and doubt. Here, reality is broken into fragments: good and bad, worthy and unworthy.<br />
This tree leads to shame, covering, and expulsion—not because of punishment, but because judgment robs the soul of its creative boldness.</p><h2><strong>Absalom: Snared in the Tree of Judgment</strong></h2><p>In 2 Samuel 18, <b><a href="/2025/04/absaloms-hair.html">Absalom is caught by his hair in the branches of a tree</a></b>. Hair often symbolises thoughts. Here is a soul suspended in its own mental entanglement—lifted from the earth, yet not rising into new life. It is a vivid picture of the divided self: clinging to pride and appearance, unable to descend into humility or ascend into transformation.<br />
Absalom is not merely a prince at war—he is the archetype of the mind trapped in the judgment tree.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Absalom was riding his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak. Absalom’s head caught in the tree. He was left hanging in mid-air, while the mule he was riding kept on going.”</em><br />
— 2 Samuel 18:9</p>
</blockquote><p>His downfall was not just in the battlefield, but in the entanglement of self-image—suspended in thought, unable to yield.</p><p></p><blockquote>“And the LORD God commanded the man, ‘You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you must not eat, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.’” — Genesis 2:16–17 (NIV)</blockquote><p></p><h2><strong>Jesus: Crucified on the Tree of Life</strong></h2><p>By contrast, <strong><a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a></strong> is also <a href="/2025/06/crucifixion-cross-or-tree-symbolic.html"><b>hanged on a tree</b></a> (Acts 5:30)—but this tree becomes the Tree of Life. His crucifixion symbolises the <em>fixing of consciousness</em> in a new identity. He does not judge by appearances but lives from the end, declaring, “<a href="/2025/05/creation-is-finished-stepping-into.html">It is finished</a>.” The cross becomes not a death sentence, but a point of assumption—a stabilising of the inner '<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>' in <b><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">love and purpose</a></b>.<br />
He does not eat from the tree of opposites; He <em>is</em> the <b><a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a></b> of the Tree of Life planted in every heart.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus—whom you had killed by hanging Him on a tree.”</em><br />
— Acts 5:30</p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>Nebuchadnezzar: From Knowledge to Life</strong></h2><p>In Daniel 4, <b><a href="/2025/06/daniel-chapter-4-verses-1-18-symbolism.html">Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a towering tree</a></b> reaching to heaven—commanding, vast, and nourishing the earth. It is a picture of worldly greatness—majestic, yet rooted in self-exaltation.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches.”</em><br />
— Daniel 4:11–12</p>
</blockquote><p>But this grandeur is built upon pride. Nebuchadnezzar walks in the palace and declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?”</em><br />
— Daniel 4:30</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the <b>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</b> disguised as greatness—consciousness ruled by judgment, self-glory, and control. And so, the tree is cut down.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit… nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass…”</em><br />
— Daniel 4:14–15</p>
</blockquote><p>Even in judgment, the root is preserved. The band of iron and brass seals the promise that <em>what was lost is not destroyed</em>—it may be transformed.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Let his heart be changed from a man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him… till seven times pass over him.”</em><br />
— Daniel 4:16</p>
</blockquote><p>Nebuchadnezzar is driven out until his reason returns:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High.”</em><br />
— Daniel 4:34</p>
</blockquote><p>In that moment of praise and surrender, <strong>the Tree of Life begins to grow</strong>.</p><p>The judgment-tree fell. What rises from its stump is the tree of restored awareness—<em>not of striving, but of knowing</em>. This is the Law of Assumption in action: the moment you cease to divide and begin to <em>believe from within</em>, the tree bears fruit again.</p><h2><strong>Which Tree Will You Eat From?</strong></h2><p>These trees are not relics of Eden. They stand in the mind still. One judges; the other assumes. One divides; the other unites. One leads to self-rejection; the other to creation.</p><p>To eat of the Tree of Life is to claim the “I Am” as your eternal name—and to create, not by striving or self-condemnation, but by bold assumption.<br />
Each day, each moment, we choose which tree we feed from. And the fruit we eat is the state we become.</p></body></html>
