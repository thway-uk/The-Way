<body><h1>The Seed of Abraham</h1><div style="text-align: left;">In the story of <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a>, <b><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a></b> makes a profound promise about <strong>“<a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a>”</strong>—Abraham’s descendants who will inherit the land and multiply greatly:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 12:7</strong>: <em>“To your seed will I give this land.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 13:15</strong>: <em>“To you and to your seed for ever.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 15:5</strong>: <em>“Look up into the sky and number the stars if you can. So shall your seed be.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 17:7</strong>: <em>“I will make my covenant… to be a God to you and to your seed after you.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 22:17</strong>: <em>“Your seed as many as the stars of the sky and as the sand which is on the shore of the sea.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The repeated emphasis on <strong><a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a></strong> here symbolises not just physical offspring but the creative power of promise and potential, echoing an <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">inner, spiritual principle</a>.</p>

<h3>Genesis 1:11 and the Seed Within Itself</h3>
<p>In <strong>Genesis 1:11</strong>, the Bible says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse highlights a profound understanding about the <strong>nature of creation</strong>: everything contains its <strong><a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">own seed within itself</a></strong>. The seed is the source, the blueprint, the creative power holding the potential of future growth and multiplication.</p>

<h3>Connecting Abraham’s Seed and the Seed in Creation</h3>
<p>The promise to <a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Abraham</a> about his seed is deeply symbolic of the creative power within imagination and consciousness—the <strong>“seed within”</strong> that unfolds into reality. Just as every plant yields seed after its kind, containing the potential of full growth and fruitfulness, Abraham’s seed represents the unfolding of a divine creative promise that begins within.</p>
<p>This seed is not only physical descendants but an allegory for the <strong>inner power to imagine, conceive, and bring forth new realities</strong>—the power of faith and belief as seen through Abraham’s covenant with God. His seed is the unfolding of potential, a divine creative force that mirrors the principle seen in Genesis 1:11.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abraham’s seed</strong> = The creative promise, potential, and faith manifesting as descendants and spiritual legacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:11 seed</strong> = The inherent creative power within all things, the blueprint for growth that is self-contained and self-generating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these reveal a deep spiritual principle: <strong>true creation begins from a seed within — an inner cause that unfolds into outer reality</strong>. This aligns with teachings on imagination as the creative power behind all manifestation.</p></body></html>
