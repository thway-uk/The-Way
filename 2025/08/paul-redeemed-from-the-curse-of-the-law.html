<h1>Paul: Redeemed from the Curse of The Law</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, ‘Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.’”</em><br />
— <strong>Galatians 3:13</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse may appear cryptic at first glance, but through Neville Goddard’s mystical approach, it reveals a hidden spiritual mechanism: the movement from bondage to freedom, from effort to effortless assumption—through the power of imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Curse of the Law: Living by Appearances</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s teaching, “the law” doesn’t simply refer to the Mosaic commandments—it symbolises the <strong><a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">state of consciousness bound by external cause and effect</a></strong>.</p><p>It’s the mindset that says:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>You must earn your good through effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life rewards merit, not belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are separate from God and from fulfilment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is the <strong>curse</strong>: the belief that life happens to you from the outside, rather than through you from within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Christ as Your Imagination</strong></h3><p>Neville taught that <strong>Christ is your own human imagination</strong>—<a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">the power to assume a new state of being and make it real</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</strong><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To say that Christ redeems us from the curse of the law is to say:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Imagination frees us from the futility of trying to earn our desires through outer striving.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>It replaces toil with assumption, deserving with acceptance, striving with stillness.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Hanging on a Tree: Not Just the Cross, but Eden</strong></h3><p>The tree in Galatians 3:13 is often <a href="/2025/07/the-mark-of-beast-cains-mark-and-jesus.html">linked to the cross</a>, but its symbolism reaches even further back—to the <strong>trees of the Garden of Eden</strong>.</p><p>Neville interprets Eden as the <strong>realm of consciousness</strong>. And the trees—the <em>Tree of Life</em> and the <em>Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</em>—symbolise two inner worlds:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Life</a></strong>: unity, imagination, direct creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">Tree of Knowledge</a></strong>: duality, judgment, separation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To “hang upon a tree” is to <a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">enter this dual world: to believe in good vs evil, reward vs punishment, worthy vs unworthy</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>It is the fall into appearances—the belief in a world outside of the self.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>And yet, it is within this very state that Christ (Imagination) chooses to descend.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Imagination Redeems from Within</strong></h3><p>The phrase <em>“being made a curse for us”</em> points to a truth:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Imagination willingly enters the limited form (the tree), not to remain cursed—but to transform it from within.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not suffering for the sake of suffering. This is <strong>spiritual alchemy</strong>.</p><p>By <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assuming the state of your desire</a>—even while appearances suggest otherwise—you <strong>hang your new identity on the tree</strong>. You fix it in place. And from that crucifixion… you resurrect.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Pattern Hidden in the Verse</strong></h3><p>Galatians 3:13, decoded through Neville’s insight, reveals a spiritual pattern:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Curse</strong> – Belief in external cause (the law).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Descent</strong> – Imagination enters the body, the appearance, the limitation (the tree).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Fixing</strong> – A new state is assumed and held, despite appearances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong> – The new state takes form and sets you free.</p>
</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p>“Dare to assume that you are what you want to be and you will compel everyone to play their part.”<br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>The Garden Was Never Lost</strong></h3><p>You were never truly cast out. You simply fell asleep to your own power. The tree you hang upon is also the door back in.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Tree of Knowledge</strong> represents the curse of duality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Tree of Life</strong> represents the freedom of imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christ (Imagination) <strong>hangs on one to reawaken the other</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>You are not here to escape the tree—you are here to transform it.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Final Word: Assumption Is Redemption</strong></h3><p>You are not cursed. You are not separate from your fulfilment.</p><blockquote>
<p>You are imagination, hanging on the tree of human experience, transforming it by assuming boldly—and rising in the power of what you have dared to accept as true.</p></blockquote>
