<body><h1>The Persistent Widow</h1><p>In Luke 18:1–8, <a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html" target="_blank"><b>Jesus</b></a> tells a parable to teach persistent prayer and faith that does not lose heart. Beneath the surface, it reveals a deeper spiritual truth about the <strong>state of the feminine mind</strong>—the receptive, imaginative aspect—when it is <strong><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">unmarried, uncleaved, and unloved</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>The Widow: An Unmarried, Unloved Aspect of Mind</h3>
<p>A <strong><a href="/2025/05/the-many-faces-of-subconscious-women-of.html">widow</a></strong> is more than a <a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html"><b>woman</b></a> without a husband; symbolically, she represents the <strong>feminine aspect of the mind</strong>—the subconscious or receptive imagination—that has been <strong>cut off, <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">uncleaved, and unloved</a></strong> by the conscious “<b><a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a></b>.” She knows desire but lacks the deliberate identity to claim it, standing alone and seeking justice—a plea for recognition and reunion.</p>

<h3>The Judge: Detached Moral Authority</h3>
<p>The <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>judge</b></a>, “who neither feared <a href="/p/elohim-god.html"><b>God</b></a> nor regarded <b><a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a></b>,” symbolizes <strong>detached, impersonal moral authority</strong>—the evaluative consciousness associated with the <strong><a href="/2025/07/the-tree-of-life-and-tree-of-knowledge.html">tree of knowledge of good and evi</a>l</strong>. This authority is indifferent, ruling without love or compassion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Persistence Moves Even Detached Authority</h3>
<p>The widow’s request for justice is not immediately granted. But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.”</em> (Luke 18:5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows that the judge gave her justice <strong>because of her persistence</strong>—her refusal to lose heart or give up. Her repeated, faithful prayer wore down the detached authority, compelling it to act.</p>
<p>Her persistence is the embodiment of <i>unwavering faith</i>—prayer that continues even when it seems unanswered. It is this steadfastness that ultimately moves the indifferent judge.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Prayer That Does Not Lose Heart</h3>
<p>Jesus introduces the parable with the clear lesson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Men ought always to pray and not lose heart.”</em> (Luke 18:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not about nagging but about <strong>faithful endurance</strong>—holding firm to the inner claim even when no visible sign appears.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Path to Union and Love</h3>
<p>The parable points to a greater truth: the <a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html">feminine mind—unmarried and unloved</a>—must be consciously <strong>wedded</strong> to the “I AM,” the deliberate creative self. Without this union, the mind remains vulnerable and must persist to gain justice.</p>
<p>When love and union are restored, the widow is no longer alone. The mind is whole, prayer fulfilled, and creation flows naturally.</p></body></html>
