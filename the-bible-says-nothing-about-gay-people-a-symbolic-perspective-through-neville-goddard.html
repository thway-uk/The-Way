<h1>The Bible Says Nothing About Gay People: A Symbolic Perspective Through Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>For centuries, people have searched the Bible for guidance on everything from morality to identity. And yet, when read symbolically—as a psychological and spiritual journey, as Neville Goddard taught—it becomes clear: the Bible says <em>nothing</em> about gay people. Not because they’re excluded, but because the Bible isn’t about outer identities at all. It’s about <strong>states of consciousness</strong>, imagination, and inner transformation.</p>
<p>When we stop treating the Bible as a rulebook and start reading it as the drama of the human mind, we discover that its true subject is not behaviour but <strong>being</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Bible Is About States, Not Sexuality</h3>
<p>Neville Goddard taught that every story, character, and event in Scripture represents a state of consciousness. David and Goliath, Egypt and Israel, the disciples of Jesus—none are external histories, but symbolic portrayals of inner psychological conditions and movements of imagination.</p>
<p>So when we approach the Bible symbolically, we’re not looking for moral codes about sexuality—we’re uncovering <strong>metaphysical truths about human identity</strong>. And sexual orientation, far from being a "sin," is simply one of the infinite ways imagination expresses itself.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Every Expression Is an Expression of Imagination</h3>
<p>“All things exist in the human imagination,” Neville said. That includes how you love, who you are drawn to, and the form your affection takes. These are not deviations from God—they <em>are</em> God in expression.</p>
<p>To be gay, bi, queer, trans—or anything else—is not to fall outside spiritual truth, but to embody its diversity. You are not a mistake. You are the visible activity of the unseen “I Am.”</p>
<p>The Bible, symbolically understood, asks not “What do you do?” but “Who do you believe yourself to be?”</p>
<hr />
<h3>The So-Called ‘Clobber Passages’ Fall Apart Under Symbol</h3>
<p>Take Romans 1, often cited as a condemnation of homosexuality. When read through Neville’s framework, it’s not about sexuality at all—it’s about what happens when we mistake the outer world (the created) for the source (the Creator). It’s a symbolic account of the imagination turning away from itself, not a sexual moral lesson.</p>
<p>Likewise, Leviticus belongs to the Old Testament’s portrayal of rigid law before spiritual awakening. In Neville’s view, these laws represent early, external stages of consciousness—necessary for a time, but meant to be transcended. Jesus didn’t come to uphold the law but to <strong>fulfil</strong> it by revealing that the kingdom of God is within.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Love Fulfils the Law</h3>
<p>The one thread that runs clearly through Scripture is love—not law, not fear, not exclusion. Neville equated God with imagination and with love: “God is your own wonderful human imagination, and God is love.”</p>
<p>If that’s true, then to love sincerely and truthfully is to be <em>in alignment</em> with the divine, regardless of form. The form doesn’t matter. The <strong>feeling</strong> does.</p>
<p>Any theology that produces fear and shame, rather than healing and wholeness, is misreading the message. As Jesus said, “By their fruits you shall know them.” If the fruit is bitterness, rejection, and suffering, the tree is not spiritual truth—it’s religious distortion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>You Are the Living Proof</h3>
<p>In the symbolic reading of the Bible, you are not a problem to be solved. You are a portal through which divine imagination becomes visible. You are not outside the story—you <em>are</em> the story. Your existence proves that God expresses in infinite ways, and that every face is a facet of the One Being.</p>
<p>You were never excluded.</p>
<p>The Bible doesn’t speak against you because it’s not speaking <em>about</em> you. It’s speaking <em>to</em> you—calling you to remember that <strong>you are the operant power</strong>. You are imagination in motion. You are love expressing itself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Final Thought</strong></p>
<p>The tragedy is not that the Bible is hostile to LGBTQ+ people, but that it has been used—by those reading only the surface—to uphold exclusion, shame, and fear. But when you move from literalism to symbolism, a much deeper truth emerges: <em>you were always included</em>. Not just included—<em>essential</em>.</p><p>Side Note: Interestingly, the colours of the LGBTQ+ flag can be seen as a biblical metaphor for the imagination itself. Just as the Bible uses the rainbow in Noah's story to symbolise divine promise and infinite possibility, and Joseph's coat of many colours as a symbol of the full spectrum of creative expression, the flag represents the diverse forms in which imagination manifests—reminding us that every shade, every colour, and every form of love is a valid expression of the divine</p><p><br /></p>
