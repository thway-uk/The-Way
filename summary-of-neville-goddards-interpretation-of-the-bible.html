    <h1>Summary of Neville Goddards interpretation of the Bible</h1>
    <p>"Neville Goddard's interpretation of Jesus, based on his online work, is deeply symbolic and psychological, diverging significantly from traditional Christian views. Here's a summary of his key points:</p><p> * Jesus is not primarily a historical figure but a universal principle and a state of consciousness. For Goddard, the biblical stories of Jesus are allegorical representations of the spiritual journey and the awakening of divine consciousness within each individual.</p><p> * Jesus represents the "Christ within" or the "I AM" – the awareness of your own being as divine. He taught that the name Jesus is synonymous with Jehovah, and that this divine identity resides in every person. The goal is to realize and embody this inner Christ.</p><p> * The stories of Jesus depict the process of self-discovery and the manifestation of one's desires through conscious creation. Events in Jesus' life, such as miracles, the crucifixion, and resurrection, are seen as symbolic of inner transformations and the power of imagination to create reality.</p><p> * The concept of "Christ consciousness" is central. This refers to the awakened state of knowing your oneness with God and the power you possess as a creator through your imagination. Embodying Christ consciousness means living from the awareness of your desires already fulfilled.</p><p> * The Bible is a psychological drama. Goddard urged his listeners to interpret scripture metaphorically, seeing its characters and events as aspects of the human psyche and the journey to self-realization.</p><p> * Salvation is not about an external savior but the realization of your own divine nature. The name "Jesus" meaning "Jehovah saves" points to the inherent power within each person to transform their own life through a shift in consciousness.</p><p> * The emphasis is on personal experience and the power of imagination. Goddard stressed that individuals should have their own direct experience of this inner Christ rather than relying on external doctrines or historical interpretations.</p><p>In essence, Neville Goddard reframes Jesus from an external savior to an internal reality – the divine potential within every human being, waiting to be awakened through the conscious use of imagination and the realization of the "I AM."".
