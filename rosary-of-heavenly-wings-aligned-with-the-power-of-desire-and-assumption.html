<h3><strong>Opening (Introductory Invocation)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>At the Cross: Identity</strong><br />
<em>“I made you and gave you strength, and I will be your helper.” — Isaiah 41:10</em></p>
<p>I am held aloft in the embrace of the Invisible. My name is whispered on wings unseen. I am what I am—resting in the assurance that I do not carry myself. I am carried.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>First Bead: Receiving</strong></h3>
<p><em>“Are they not all spirits who take news, sent out to be servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?” — Hebrews 1:14</em></p>
<p>I receive what is mine by divine message and ministering grace. All that is mine comes to me with wings. The messengers are already dispatched.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Next Three Beads (Prepare the Soil)</strong></h3>
<p><em>“He will give you the wings of a dove covered with silver, its feathers shining with gold.” — Psalm 68:13</em><br />
<em>“You have been kept safe under the wings of the Most High.” — Psalm 91:4</em><br />
<em>“Let the word of Christ be in you in all wisdom.” — Colossians 3:16</em></p>
<p>I am a garden enclosed, kissed by winged revelation. I prepare the soil of my heart with softness, stillness, and song.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Before First Decade (Set the Mood)</strong></h3>
<p><em>“He will give his angels orders about you, to keep you in all your ways.” — Psalm 91:11</em></p>
<p>The air around me is thick with wings. I walk in the softness of divine supervision. My ways are not watched—they are witnessed. I am held and seen.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Five Decades: The Soft Power of Desire</strong></h2>
<p>Each decade includes a central verse (<em>Desire Declaration</em>) and ten affirming verses (<em>Petals</em>), drawing out the feminine themes of receptivity, faith, incubation, and fulfilment.</p>

<hr />
<h3><strong>Closing Benediction: The Quiet Flowering of the Wish</strong></h3>
