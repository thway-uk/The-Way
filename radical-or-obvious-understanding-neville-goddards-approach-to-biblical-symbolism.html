<h1>Radical or Obvious? Understanding Neville Goddard’s Approach to Biblical Symbolism</h1>
<p>Neville Goddard's interpretations of the Bible are often called "radical," but in reality, they simply make <strong>obvious</strong> the symbolic nature that has always been embedded within the text. The Bible is a <strong>book of symbols</strong>, speaking to us in a language of metaphor, allegory, and inner transformation. The reason Neville’s approach seems radical is because most readers have become accustomed to interpreting the Bible literally, which often leads to confusion and misinterpretation.</p><p>Once the <strong>symbolic nature</strong> of the Bible becomes apparent, Neville's insights are not radical at all—they are simply <strong>obvious</strong>. The stories, characters, and events in the Bible represent states of consciousness, the workings of the imagination, and the journey toward self-realisation. The Bible is not a literal history, but a spiritual guide using symbols to reveal profound truths about the creative power of the mind.</p><p>Neville doesn’t create a new interpretation; he <strong>decodes</strong> the Bible’s symbolic language, using the key of <strong>imagination</strong>. Through his teachings, we come to understand that the Bible’s true purpose is to guide us in harnessing the creative power of the imagination. What might initially appear "radical" is simply the <strong>obvious</strong> revelation that the Bible, when interpreted symbolically, becomes a powerful and transformative guide for manifesting our desires and shaping our reality.</p><p>Neville’s interpretations are not radical at all—they are a return to the Bible’s original message: that imagination is the force that shapes both our inner and outer worlds. It’s a message that has always been there, waiting for us to unlock it.</p><p><br /></p>
