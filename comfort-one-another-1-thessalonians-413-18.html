    <h1>Comfort One Another: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18:</h1>
    <p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:13 :</strong></p><p>
<em>"But we do not want you to be without knowledge, brothers, about those who have gone to their rest, so that you may not be sad like others who have no hope."</em></p></blockquote><p><em></em></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
In Neville Goddard’s framework, this passage speaks to the idea that we must not be ignorant of the power of imagination, or the ability to shape our reality. Those who have "gone to their rest" represent the thoughts or assumptions that we’ve allowed to fade or that have been unexamined. The "sadness" is akin to the emotional response when we forget or doubt the power of our imagination. Just as the passage encourages hope, Neville teaches that we should not mourn over our past thoughts or assumptions. Instead, we must embrace the knowledge that the imagination (and therefore, the assumptions we hold) is the means by which we create our future.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, "brothers" are symbolic of the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">active states or thoughts within our own consciousness</a>. It refers to our own assumptions or beliefs—the "brothers" within us that guide our emotional responses and actions. So, when Paul addresses "brothers," Neville would interpret this as a call to align the various thoughts and assumptions in our minds towards the truth of our creative power. It is about recognising that the support or comfort we seek from others is within us, in the form of our assumptions and inner conversations.</p><hr /><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:14:</strong><br />
<em>"For if we have faith that Jesus died and came again, even so those who have gone to their rest through Jesus will God make them come with him."</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Neville would interpret the death and resurrection of Jesus as the symbolic process of surrendering old, limiting beliefs (death) and assuming new, powerful beliefs (resurrection). This verse, in Neville’s view, suggests that by having faith (or assuming the reality of a desired outcome), we can bring into manifestation those things that seem "dead" in our lives. Just as the dead are brought back to life through Christ (our imagination), we too can breathe life into any situation by aligning our assumptions with the desired outcome.</p><hr /><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:15:</strong><br />
<em>"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living and remain until the coming of the Lord will not go before those who have gone to their rest."</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
This passage indicates that those who "are living" are not left behind—they will not go before those who have "gone to their rest." In Neville's teachings, this suggests that your desires (or the assumptions you hold in your imagination) are always within reach, regardless of where you are currently. Whether you are consciously aware of it or not, your imagination is the key to unlocking the things you desire. Even if things seem "resting" or dormant now, they will come alive in their perfect time, according to the assumptions you hold.</p><hr /><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:16:</strong><br />
<em>"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a call, with the voice of the archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first:"</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
Neville would likely interpret the "Lord coming down from heaven" as the awakening of the higher mind or the divine imagination, which is always accessible to us. The "archangel" symbolises the heightened consciousness that calls us to awaken to our own power. The "trumpet" signifies the clear and powerful announcement of the realisation of what has been assumed. The "dead in Christ rising first" represents the bringing to life of those things in our life that have been assumed and forgotten, which are now called forth into reality.</p><hr /><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:17:</strong><br />
<em>"Then we who are living, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so we will be with the Lord for ever."</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
The "living" in this passage are those who are consciously engaging with their imagination to create their desired reality. "Caught up" represents the experience of being elevated into a higher state of consciousness where the manifestation of desires is inevitable. The "clouds" symbolise the unseen realms, or the imaginal world, where everything is created first. Meeting the "Lord in the air" signifies the union between the individual’s mind (their imagination) and the divine creative power, where all things are possible. Once this union occurs, we are with the "Lord forever"—which can be interpreted as always being aligned with the creative power of our assumptions.</p><hr /><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:18:</strong><br />
<em>"So then, comfort one another with these words."</em></blockquote><em></em><p></p><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
In Neville Goddard's teachings, "comfort one another" is not just a call to reassure others, but a reminder to comfort yourself in your thoughts. The "comfort" here is about soothing your own mind, especially when "one another" suggests division, and doubt arises. It’s about reaffirming the power of your assumptions. By consciously choosing to align your thoughts with your desires and recognising that your imagination creates your reality, you comfort yourself and ease the struggle of the conscious mind. This process of self-comforting aligns you with your desired outcomes, reinforcing the idea that your imagination is the key to all things. By doing so, you invite your desires into reality, creating peace and certainty within yourself as you assume the state of your wish fulfilled.</p><hr /><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
In summary, when read through the lens of Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 offers a profound lesson about the power of imagination and the need to align your assumptions with your desires. The passage encourages us to embrace hope, comfort ourselves with the knowledge that our assumptions shape our reality, and to recognise that the power of imagination is the bridge between our desires and their manifestation. Through these teachings, we are reminded that we are always in control of what we create, and that by assuming the desired state, we bring life to our wishes, just as Christ brings life to the dead.</p>
