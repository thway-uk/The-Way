<h1>Living in the End: The Many Facets of Manifestation Rooted in Scripture</h1>
<p><strong>Neville Goddard always taught that living in the end is the key to manifestation.</strong></p><p>
But this isn’t a mechanical trick or shallow technique. It is a deeply symbolic, sacred, and scriptural process that involves love, desire, assumption, vision, and reverence. These are not separate ideas, but facets of the one law at work.</p><p>The Twelve disciples in the New Testament exemplify this perfectly — a gathering of conscious states that support and assist the Assumption into manifestation.</p><p>To truly live in the end — what Neville called the <strong>Lord’s assumption</strong> — is to enter into union with the state you long to experience, and surrender to it as if it were already so. But this process is rich, layered, and biblically grounded in ways that are often overlooked.</p><hr /><h3>1. The Lord’s Assumption: Declaring the End from the Beginning</h3><p>Neville equated living in the end with the divine act of creation.<br />
<strong>“Declare the end from the beginning,”</strong> says <em>Isaiah 46:10</em> — not as a poetic line, but as a spiritual instruction. The Lord (your I AM) assumes the fulfilment. To assume a new state is to accept it as present and true, and to act as though no other reality exists.</p><blockquote>
<p>This is not effort — this is identity.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>2. Love and Desire: The Fuel of the Inner Act</h3><p>Desire is not to be suppressed or judged — Neville said, <strong>“Desire is the gift of God.”</strong><br />
But desire on its own is not enough. The assumed state must be loved. It must be felt as lovely. This love becomes the emotional signature that brings it to life.</p><p>This is echoed in <em>Daniel 10:11</em>, where the prophet is called <strong>“greatly beloved.”</strong> Why? Because he receives vision, and stands firm in it. The longing of the heart — like Jacob’s desire for Rachel — gives power to the assumption.<br />
Love and desire are not weaknesses; they are the magnetism that draws the new state into embodiment.</p><hr /><h3>3. Dominion: The State Takes Rule</h3><p>When you live in the end, you’re not trying to make something happen — you are yielding to a new reality. The assumed state takes dominion over your consciousness. Neville would describe this as letting the new state rule you as Lord.</p><p>In <em>Daniel 2</em>, the stone not cut by hands smashes the statue of former kingdoms and grows into a great mountain — a symbol of the Kingdom of Heaven, or your assumed desire made manifest. These kingdoms represent former states of being, and the stone (your assumption) shatters them. The new state has dominion.</p><hr /><h3>4. Visions in Daniel and Ezekiel: Revelation of the Creative Law</h3><p>Neville often returned to the books of Daniel and Ezekiel — not as apocalyptic texts, but as metaphors for inner spiritual operations.</p><p>Daniel’s visions portray the fall of outer kingdoms — which symbolise mental constructs. Every external authority collapses in the face of inner knowing. As Neville taught: <strong>your world reflects your state.</strong></p><p>Ezekiel’s wheels within wheels, the four-faced creatures, and the chariot of glory symbolise the multi-directional, interconnected nature of inner states.<br />
<em>“The Spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels”</em> (Ezekiel 1:20) — a direct echo of the idea that your inner state drives your external world. Nothing is happening ‘out there’; all things are moved by the inner wheel of consciousness.</p><p>These visions are not about future history, but present identity.</p><hr /><h3>5. Adoration: The Mystical Heart of Manifestation</h3><p>A subtle but powerful teaching Neville carried was the idea of <strong>adoration</strong> — not in the religious sense, but in the mystical one. He quoted, <em>“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,”</em> and revealed that the Lord here is the state you assume.</p><p>To adore your end is to make it sacred. To dwell in it with worshipful reverence is to embody it. This inner reverence is what gives the state vitality. Without love, assumption is hollow. But with adoration, it becomes creative.</p><hr /><h3>6. Faith as Substance: The Invisible Made Real</h3><p><em>Hebrews 11:1</em> declares, <strong>“Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</strong> Neville drew on this passage to show that faith is not blind belief but spiritual substance — the felt reality of what has not yet appeared.</p><p>Faith, in this sense, is the very form of the unseen. When you live in the end, you are not hoping — you are standing in the invisible form, clothed in conviction. The world may deny it, but faith holds the shape.<br />
<strong>“It is done”</strong> is not metaphor, but real creative law.</p><hr /><h3>7. The Cross as Fixation: Dying to the Old</h3><p>Neville taught that the crucifixion is the symbolic fixing of an idea in imagination.<br />
<strong>“Your cross is your assumption fixed.”</strong> This is not suffering, but surrender — the moment of no return when the old man dies and the new state is fully accepted.</p><p><em>Galatians 2:20</em> says, <strong>“I AM crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live.”</strong> This is the inner transformation that occurs when your desire becomes your only identity. To live in the end is to crucify doubt, hesitation, and questioning. You are nailed to the truth of who you now are.</p><p>And that is resurrection.</p><hr /><h3>8. The Name of the Lord: 'I AM' as the Door</h3><p>When Moses asked God for His name, He was told:<br />
<strong>“I AM THAT I AM”</strong> (<em>Exodus 3:14</em>). Neville called this the most powerful revelation in scripture — the key to manifestation.</p><p>To assume a state in the name of the Lord is to say:<br />
<strong>“I AM that fulfilled one.”</strong> Not “I will be,” not “I hope to be” — but <strong>I AM.</strong> When you live in the end, you declare from the present tense. You pass through the only door that exists: the awareness of being. The Lord is your own I AM.</p><p>What you attach to that name becomes your world.</p><hr /><h3>9. The Marriage Supper: Union With the Desired State</h3><p><em>Revelation 19:7–9</em> speaks of the marriage supper of the Lamb — an image often misunderstood. Neville saw this not as prophecy, but as present reality. It is the mystical union between you and your fulfilled desire.</p><p>To live in the end is to marry the state. You take its name. You live in its house. You no longer court the desire as separate — you become it.<br />
<strong>“The two shall become one flesh”</strong> is not merely about people, but about you and your assumption. What you assume, you become.</p><p>This is the sacred marriage of imagination and identity.</p><hr /><h3>10. Mercy and Allowing: The Grace to Receive Your Own Desire</h3><p>One of the most overlooked aspects of living in the end is mercy — not as pity, but as divine allowance. To manifest the desires of the heart, one must first permit them. This inner permission is what Neville called grace. It is the spiritual softness that receives rather than resists.</p><p><em>Psalm 37:4</em> says, <strong>“Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.”</strong> But what if the ‘giving’ is not from outside, but from within? What if the Lord — your I AM — is only waiting on your own consent?</p><p>Desire is holy, but so too is allowance. Many reject their own longings with guilt or hesitation, never granting themselves what is already theirs in consciousness. Mercy is the act of embracing the self that already is fulfilled, and letting go of all inward punishment that says, <strong>“I cannot”</strong> or <strong>“I do not deserve.”</strong></p><p>This is the inner forgiveness that clears the ground for creation. It is the Father seeing the prodigal son from afar and running — not to scold, but to robe and ring him. The robe is identity. The ring is covenant. You are always met with celebration when you return to the state that is yours.</p><p>To live in the end is not to force; it is to allow yourself to be loved by your own desire. It is to stop arguing with your good and instead welcome it, knowing it was always prepared for you.</p><hr /><h3>It Is Not Just Assumption — It Is Transformation</h3><p>Living in the end is not a trick. It is the enthronement of a new state of being. Neville saw the Bible not as a moral guidebook or historical record, but as <strong>“the greatest psychological book ever written.”</strong> Every character and vision points to this great truth: <strong>you become what you assume yourself to be — and the assumption, when loved, believed, and revered, becomes flesh.</strong></p>
