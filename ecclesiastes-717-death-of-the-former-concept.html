<h1>Ecclesiastes 7:1–7: Death of the Former Concept</h1>
<p>This passage from Ecclesiastes is filled with poetic contradiction—on the surface, it reads like a lament. But when viewed through the Law of Assumption, it becomes a profound meditation on the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html"><strong>death of a former concept of self</strong> </a>and the uncomfortable, necessary process of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">conscious</a> rebirth. Each verse points not to outer events, but to the inner journey.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:1</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“A good name is better than oil of great price, and the day of death than the day of birth.”</strong></p>
<p>A “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">good name</a>” symbolises your <strong>assumed identity—your chosen concept of self</strong>. This is not about your reputation, but about what you claim inwardly: <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>. Such a name—held firmly in imagination—is more precious than any outer accomplishment or enhancement.</p>
<p>The “day of death” refers to <strong>the conscious abandonment of a former <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self-image</a></strong>, while “birth” is entering life unconsciously, shaped by assumptions inherited from the world. There is more power in dying deliberately to what no longer serves you than in being born unaware.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:2</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“It is better to go to the house of weeping than to the house of feasting: for this is the end of all men, and the living will put it to heart.”</strong></p>
<p>The “house of weeping” represents inner awareness—the uncomfortable moment you realise your life reflects assumptions you didn’t choose consciously. This is the point where the former self-image begins to fall apart.</p>
<p>Feasting, in contrast, is the distraction of outer pleasure. But only those who dwell in reflection will truly live. Neville taught that this kind of discomfort is sacred—it signals the stirring of new life.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:3</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Sorrow is better than laughing: for by the sadness of the face the heart may be made better.”</strong></p>
<p>Sorrow here is symbolic of <strong>inner awakening</strong>. When you feel the weight of recognising your old assumptions, the heart—the subconscious—becomes tender and receptive. This is when the work of planting a new assumption begins.</p>
<p>Laughter, in this sense, is the denial or avoidance of that inner work. Neville would call this the difference between <strong>reactivity</strong> and <strong>re-creation</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:4</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“The heart of the wise is in the house of sorrow; but the heart of the foolish is in the house of joy.”</strong></p>
<p>The wise allow themselves to reflect, to feel, and to shift. They understand that <strong>discomfort often precedes transformation</strong>. It’s not about mourning in the literal sense, but about confronting inner resistance and choosing a new state of being.</p>
<p>The foolish refuse to enter this house of inner work. They stay on the surface, ignoring the power of assumption and relying on appearances.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:5</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“It is better to take note of the protest of the wise, than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish.”</strong></p>
<p>The protest or correction of the wise is that <strong>your world is yourself pushed out</strong>. It’s not always a message you want to hear—it requires full responsibility for your reality. But hearing it awakens you.</p>
<p>The “song of the foolish” is the chorus of outer voices that insist you’re just a victim of circumstance. Neville would say: that song has no creative power.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:6</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Like the cracking of thorns under a pot, so is the laugh of a foolish man; and this again is to no purpose.”</strong></p>
<p>The laughter of the foolish—those who dismiss inner work—is noisy but hollow. It makes a show, but gives no real heat, no transformation. Neville would point out that <strong>your quiet assumption carries more power than all the mockery of the outer world combined</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:7</strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Wisdom is made foolish by need, and the shining face of authority is changed by a bribe.”</strong></p>
<p>Even one who understands the truth of imagination can falter under pressure. When outer need becomes too loud, one might be tempted to <strong>abandon the inner vision for the illusion of outer stability</strong>.</p>
<p>The “bribe” is any compromise that causes you to settle—to forsake your ideal for something that seems safer. But Neville would remind you: <strong>you become what you assume</strong>, not what you observe. Refuse the bribe. Persist in the assumption.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Closing Summary</strong></h3>
<p>These verses are not promoting sadness—they are describing the spiritual courage it takes to leave behind an inherited identity and deliberately choose a new state of being. Sorrow is only a symbol for the <strong>moment of awareness</strong>, where the former self begins to dissolve. And in that very mourning, the new name is born.</p>
<p>Neville said, “You must be willing to die to your present concept of self in order to live to the one you desire to be.”<br />
This is Ecclesiastes 7:1–7 in essence: <strong>an invitation to inner death and resurrection, through assumption</strong>.</p>
