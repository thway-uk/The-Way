<h1>Doomscrolling TikTok: Neville Goddard’s Worst Nightmare</h1>
<p>Picture this: Neville Goddard, with his ever-present understanding of the power of imagination, watches as we scroll endlessly through TikTok. “My dear friends,” he’d gently remind us, “you’re doing it all wrong.”</p>
<p>Here’s the deal—doomscrolling is essentially like trying to find a state of being to assume by aimlessly flipping through the endless, random collection of videos on your feed. You’re hoping that one will spark joy, inspiration, or at least a chuckle. But in reality? You’re not imagining <em>your</em> best life. Instead, you’re allowing TikTok to set the tone for your emotions. Not exactly Neville-approved.</p>
<p>Instead of letting some random clip about a ‘life hack’ decide how you feel, Neville would tell you: <em>assume the state of the person you want to be.</em> You won’t manifest your ideal reality by watching endless tutorials on how to make a cake levitate (as fun as that sounds). No, you’ve got to feel yourself in that state of success and abundance <em>before</em> it shows up in your life.</p>
<p>So, the next time you find yourself lost in a TikTok rabbit hole, remember: You’re not meant to search for inspiration in viral trends. You’re meant to create your own inspiration by assuming the state of the life you truly desire. Imagine it, embody it, and leave the viral dances to those who’ve forgotten about the real magic of imagination.</p>
