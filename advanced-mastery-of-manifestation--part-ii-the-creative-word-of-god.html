<h1>Advanced Mastery of Manifestation — Part II: The Creative Word of God</h1>
Consider:<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” — Genesis 1:3</strong></p><p>
<strong>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” — John 1:1</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong></strong></p><h3>Psychological Key:</h3><p>Neville Goddard taught that <strong>“God”</strong> in Scripture is the <em>I AM</em> within you—your own consciousness. The “Word” is not speech in the outer world but the <em>inner conversation</em> you carry on with yourself. It is the invisible cause behind all visible effects.</p><p>In <strong>Genesis 1</strong>, God does not labour or struggle—He simply <em>speaks</em>. He <em>declares</em> the end from the beginning. The spoken Word is an <strong>assumption made with faith</strong>, and it immediately sets spiritual law in motion.</p><p>In <strong>John 1:1</strong>, the “Word” is identified as <strong>both with God and as God</strong>—revealing that consciousness and speech are inseparable. Your inner Word <em>is</em> the God-state creating your world.</p><h3>Manifestation Principle:</h3><p><strong>Creation begins not with effort, but with a Word.</strong><br />
The Word is not external speech but <strong>felt inner knowing</strong>, a declaration of being. You do not beg, plead, or strive. You <em>say</em>, inwardly: <em>“I am.”</em> And this “I AM” sets the tone for what you experience.</p><p>To speak "Let there be light" is to announce clarity, awareness, and manifestation. “Light” symbolises the moment when what was unseen becomes seen—when assumption begins to take shape.</p><h3>Application:</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>When you affirm <em>“I am wealthy,” “I am loved,” “I am free,”</em> you are not hoping—it is a <strong>creative act</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner speech is <strong>the womb of reality</strong>. Guard it. Cultivate it. Speak <em>as though</em> the Word is already flesh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never say what you do not want to see. Every idle word (assumption without feeling) either delays or contradicts your manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Advanced Manifestation Tip:</h3><p>When you feel stuck or doubtful, stop and <em>speak deliberately</em>:<br />
<strong>“Let there be light.”</strong><br />
This is not a plea—it’s a spiritual reset. It reclaims your authority as the creative power in your own world.</p>
