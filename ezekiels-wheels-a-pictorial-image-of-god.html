    <h1>Ezekiel’s Wheels: A Pictorial Image of God</h1>
    <p>One of the mysterious and poetic images in the Bible appears in the Book of Ezekiel: <strong>“a wheel in the middle of a wheel”</strong> (Ezekiel 1:16). At first glance, this vision may seem abstract, mechanical, or even confusing. However, through the teachings of Neville Goddard, we uncover a deeply meaningful symbol of inner transformation, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">conscious movement</a>, and the multi-layered nature of our imagination.</p><h3>The Vision: Ezekiel’s Wheels</h3><p>Ezekiel writes:</p><blockquote>
<p>“This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: they sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</p><p>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around"</p><p>
— Ezekiel 1:15-18 NKJV</p>
</blockquote><p>This heavenly vision depicts complex, living wheels full of eyes, moving effortlessly in all directions without needing to turn in the usual way. </p><p></p><blockquote>“And the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about.” — Ezekiel 10:12 </blockquote><p></p><p>Far from being a literal machine, Neville interprets this imagery as a symbol of the self-regulating, multidimensional movement of consciousness.</p><h3>Elohim: The Plural Majesty of Divine Consciousness</h3><p>To fully appreciate Ezekiel’s vision, we must consider the <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">Hebrew name for God</a> used throughout the Old Testament: <strong>Elohim</strong> (אֱלֹהִים). According to Strong’s Concordance (#430) and interlinear Hebrew sources, <strong>Elohim is a plural noun</strong>—literally meaning “mighty ones” or “divine ones.” It is derived from the root <strong>’El (אל)</strong>, meaning “mighty” or “strong one,” with the plural masculine suffix <strong>-im</strong>.</p><p>Despite its plural form, Elohim typically refers to the <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">one true God acting as a singular, unified being</a></strong>, often taking singular verbs in the text. This grammatical paradox expresses the <strong>plural majesty and fullness of God’s power</strong>, suggesting a unity composed of many divine attributes and creative forces working in harmony.</p><p>Just like the “wheel within a wheel” that moves seamlessly in multiple directions, <strong>Elohim represents a dynamic unity—a divine consciousness that is many and yet one</strong>. This plurality within unity reflects the complex, multidimensional nature of imagination and awareness itself.</p><h3>The Inner and Outer Wheels: Consciousness in Motion</h3><p>Neville taught that all outward movement begins in the imagination. The <strong>outer wheel</strong> represents the physical world, the visible events and conditions we experience. The <strong>inner wheel</strong>, hidden yet central, is our own awareness—the “I AM” at the core—turning quietly and generating the outer reality.</p><p>In Neville’s words, <strong>“The world is yourself pushed out.”</strong> The image of a wheel turning within a wheel powerfully illustrates how your outer life rotates in harmony with your inner assumptions and beliefs.</p><p>This is not static. The wheels suggest perpetual motion and transformation. Your beliefs, emotions, and assumptions are continuously turning. When you change the inner wheel—your self-concept—the outer wheel, the world you perceive, naturally follows.</p><h3>The Many Eyes: Self-Awareness and Watchfulness</h3><p>Ezekiel’s wheels are covered in eyes, symbolising awareness and watchfulness. For Neville, the eye represents the faculty of self-observation—the ability to notice one’s inner dialogue, emotions, and mental states.</p><p>Self-awareness is the key to deliberate creation. You cannot change your reality without first observing and understanding where your inner wheel is turning.</p><h3>Spirals, Layers, and Dimensions of Consciousness</h3><p>A wheel within a wheel is not merely about cause and effect but depth and dimension. Self-perception is not linear; it spirals and loops. The recurring challenges and patterns in life are not failures but deeper layers of growth—wheels turning inside wheels, drawing you closer to full self-realisation.</p><p>Neville emphasised that states of consciousness exist on multiple levels. What appears as repetition can be the ascending spiral of transformation.</p><h3>From Elohim to Legion: The Original and the Fragmented States</h3><p>Elohim, with its plural majesty, expresses the <strong>original, unpolluted state of divine consciousness</strong>—whole, unified, and multidimensional. This contrasts sharply with the state symbolised in the <a href="/2025/04/legion-according-to-neville-goddard.html">story of Legion</a> (Mark 5:1–20), where many fragmented inner voices or “demons” possess a man, representing a consciousness splintered into victimhood and limiting beliefs.</p><p>The vision of Ezekiel’s wheels and the name Elohim remind us of the <strong>pure creative power within us</strong>, the original “wheel” of imagination and conscious awareness before it becomes scattered or polluted by fear, doubt, and fragmentation.</p><h3>Conclusion: You Are the Centre of the Divine Movement</h3><p>The wheel within a wheel teaches that we are not powerless observers but the centre of all reality. The core wheel is your imagination—your “I AM”—the divine creative power spinning the visible world into being.</p><p>When life feels chaotic or repetitive, remember: the outer wheel responds to the inner one. Your assumptions, feelings, and inner speech turn the mechanism of your world, even if you don’t yet see the results.</p><p>By consciously moving the inner wheel—imagining boldly, believing faithfully, and feeling deeply—you align with the sacred machinery of Elohim, the many-mighty One, who continuously creates and sustains all things.</p>
