    <h1>The Parable of the Talents: A Divine Trust in Imagination</h1>
    <p>In Matthew 25:14–30, Jesus tells a parable often misunderstood as a lesson about worldly productivity or financial stewardship. But when seen through the understanding Neville Goddard offers—the Bible as a psychological drama—the story takes on a far more personal and transformative meaning. This is not about coins. It is about <strong>consciousness</strong>, <strong>imagination</strong>, and the sacred <strong>trust of creative power</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Setup: A Journey and a Distribution</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.”</em><br />
— Matthew 25:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "man" is a symbol of the <strong>I AM</strong>, the Higher Self—consciousness itself—who departs and entrusts its <strong>servants</strong>, or <em>states of mind</em>, with varying measures of talent. In ancient times, a <em>talent</em> was a large sum of money, but here it symbolises a deeper resource: the <strong>power to imagine, believe, and create</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To one, five talents are given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To another, two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to a third, one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each according to their capacity. No judgement—just a distribution of <strong>creative ability</strong>. All are entrusted with <em>something</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Response: Investment or Fear</strong></h3>
<p>Two servants "go and trade"—they <strong>act</strong>, they <strong>assume</strong>, they <strong>apply</strong>. They double what they were given. These are the states of consciousness that <strong>believe in imagination</strong>, that invest faith into unseen outcomes and act as if they are already real.</p>
<p>But one servant buries his talent in the ground. He hides it. He fears his master. He believes the I AM is “a hard man”—judgemental, punishing, distant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.”</em><br />
— Matthew 25:25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the mind that <strong>refuses to imagine differently</strong>, paralysed by outer facts and inner fear. He plays it safe and returns exactly what he was given: <strong>nothing ventured, nothing gained</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Master’s Return: Revealing the Inner State</strong></h3>
<p>When the master returns—when higher awareness revisits these states—it does not praise passivity. It rewards the servants who <strong>used</strong> their talents, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Well done, thou good and faithful servant… I will make thee ruler over many things.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because imagination, like a muscle, strengthens with use. <strong>Conscious creation expands its own capacity</strong>. Neville taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“To him that hath, it shall be given.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not as a cruelty, but as a spiritual law. The one who <em>uses imagination</em> gains more power to do so. The one who refuses loses even the awareness he had.</p>
<p>The “wicked and slothful” servant is not morally bad. He’s just <strong>idle in imagination</strong>. He avoids the risk of faith and remains at the mercy of outer facts.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>What Does This Mean for Us?</strong></h3>
<p>We are each entrusted with a portion of the divine creative power—<strong>imagination</strong>. This parable reminds us that we are <em>meant</em> to use it. Not cautiously, not sparingly—but with boldness.</p>
<p>The five-talent and two-talent servants didn’t just sit and hope. They <strong>acted on faith</strong>. They took their invisible wealth and made it visible. They entered into the feeling of already having, already being.</p>
<p>The one-talent servant stands as a warning to every moment we say, “It won’t work,” “I can’t,” or “It’s safer not to hope.” That <em>buries</em> the power. That hides the divine within the earth of doubt.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Use What You Have</strong></h3>
<p>This parable is not about comparison. It doesn’t matter if you start with five talents or one. What matters is <strong>use</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel it real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk as though it’s already true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The kingdom of heaven—the realm of fulfilled desire—belongs to those who act from within, trusting the power given to them.</p>
<p>So dig up the talent. Dust off the imagination. Use it—boldly, faithfully—and watch as more is given.</p>
