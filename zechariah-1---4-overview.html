    <h1>Zechariah 1 - 4 Overview</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard's <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> teaches that by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled—believing our desire is already realized—we tap into the creative power of imagination. The book of <strong>Zechariah</strong>, especially Chapters 1 and 2, beautifully illustrates this process, revealing how assumptions shape spiritual transformation and manifestation.</p><h2><strong>Zechariah 1: Realigning Assumptions</strong></h2><p>Zechariah 1 opens with a call from God: <strong>“Return to me, and I will return to you”</strong> (Zechariah 1:3, NIV). In Neville’s framework, this <strong>returning</strong> means shifting to the assumption of our desired state. When we assume the feeling of fulfillment, our inner world begins to transform outwardly.</p><p>In the vision of the <strong>four horses</strong> (Zechariah 1:8), we see the <strong>four winds</strong>, representing universal forces that propel us when we assume a new state. These winds are the creative energies unleashed by our assumptions, moving through our consciousness to manifest our desires.</p><p><strong>Zechariah 1:14</strong> reflects God’s deep yearning for alignment with us, symbolizing the intensity of our desire to shift consciousness. <strong>The nations at ease</strong> represent unchallenged subconscious assumptions, which must be transformed to manifest change.</p><h2><strong>Zechariah 2: The New Jerusalem—A Limitless Reality</strong></h2><p>Chapter 2 introduces the <strong>New Jerusalem</strong>, a city without walls, symbolising the <strong>unlimited nature of imagination</strong>. When we assume our desired state, we remove all limitations, aligning ourselves with divine creation. The <strong>wall of fire</strong> in Zechariah 2:5 represents the <strong>protective power</strong> of our assumptions, shielding us from doubts as we manifest our desires.</p><p>Zechariah calls the scattered people of Israel to <strong>flee from the land of the north</strong>, symbolising the need to leave limiting beliefs and embrace new assumptions. <strong>God dwelling in the midst of us</strong> (Zechariah 2:10-11) signifies the divine presence within, guiding our manifestation process and ensuring that we are always connected to the creative force of the universe.</p><h2><strong>Zechariah 2:8 – "The Apple of His Eye"</strong></h2><p>Zechariah 2:8 states, <strong>“He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.”</strong> The <strong>apple of the eye</strong> symbolizes the core of our being—the subconscious, where our assumptions are formed. In Neville’s terms, this reflects the sacredness of our assumptions. When we align with divine truth, we are <strong>protected</strong>, and the world must yield to our assumptions.</p><h2><strong>Zechariah 4: The Olive Trees and Angels</strong></h2><p>Zechariah 4 presents <strong>two olive trees</strong> and <strong>two angels</strong> (Zechariah 4:3, 11-14), which align with Neville’s teachings on the Law of Assumption. The <strong>olive trees</strong> represent the <strong>unlimited flow of divine energy</strong> available when we assume the desired state, while the <strong>angels</strong> are the <strong>divine messengers</strong> guiding us to manifest our desires.</p><p>The two <strong>angels</strong> signify the conscious and subconscious mind working together to bring our assumptions to reality, while the <strong>olive trees</strong> provide the <strong>continuous supply of creative energy</strong> that fuels manifestation.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Manifestation through Assumption</strong></h2><p>Zechariah 1 and 2, viewed through Neville’s Law of Assumption, offer profound insights into spiritual awakening. By assuming the state of the wish fulfilled, we realign with divine creativity. The <strong>New Jerusalem</strong> symbolises the limitless imagination, while the <strong>four winds</strong> and <strong>four horses</strong> represent the creative energies that move through us when we assume a new state of being. Embracing this law allows us to unlock the divine potential within, transforming our inner world and manifesting our desires.</p>
