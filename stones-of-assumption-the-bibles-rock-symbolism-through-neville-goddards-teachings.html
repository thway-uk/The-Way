    <h1>Stones of Assumption: The Bible’s Rock Symbolism Through Neville Goddard’s Teachings</h1>
    <p>In Scripture, stones and rocks appear again and again—as altars, monuments, weapons, and foundations. But through the spiritual psychology of Neville Goddard, these are not just physical objects. They symbolise fixed assumptions, enduring states of consciousness, and the beliefs upon which our lives are built. What we assume becomes our world, and stones in the Bible are the outward symbols of what has been inwardly accepted as truth.</p>
<p><strong>Joshua’s Twelve Stones: Anchoring the New State</strong><br />
In Joshua 4:20, twelve stones are set up after the Israelites cross the Jordan River—one for each tribe. For Neville, this moment represents the crossing from one state of consciousness into another. The stones symbolise the establishment of a new identity—each one marking a part of the self now aligned with the promise. They are a memorial not to what was done, but to what was believed and assumed to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Moses Striking the Rock: Forcing vs. Assuming</strong><br />
When Moses strikes the rock in Numbers 20:11 to bring forth water, he is acting from frustration rather than faith. In Neville’s interpretation, this illustrates the danger of trying to force outer results rather than calmly assuming the fulfilment. The “rock” is the hard state of consciousness—seemingly unyielding until approached in faith. Water flows when consciousness is rightly moved—not when it is struck in anger.</p>
<p><strong>The Stone the Builders Rejected: Imagination Dismissed</strong><br />
Psalm 118:22 says, <em>“The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.”</em> This stone is the imaginative power of “I Am”—rejected by the logical mind (the builders), but essential to creation. According to Neville, imagination is the cornerstone of reality. What is dismissed as unrealistic or foolish is often the very power by which the world is formed.</p>
<p><strong>“Upon this Rock I Will Build My Church”</strong><br />
When Jesus says to Peter, <em>“Upon this rock I will build my church”</em> (Matthew 16:18), he speaks of the inner revelation: <em>“Thou art the Christ.”</em> This recognition of divine identity—the awareness that <em>I Am</em> is the source—is the rock upon which the whole structure of your life (the "church") is built. The assumption of being what you long to be is the true foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Stoning: Condemnation by Assumption</strong><br />
In many biblical accounts, stoning is the chosen method of execution. Through Neville’s lens, stoning symbolises the destructive power of mass belief—the mental stones of judgement, limitation, and external opinion. When we accept the assumptions of others, especially those rooted in fear or separation, we are "stoned" by the collective consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>David and Goliath: One Stone of Faith</strong><br />
David defeats Goliath not with a sword but with a stone (1 Samuel 17:49). He selects five, but uses only one—symbolising the single-minded assumption of victory. David does not rely on the outer appearance of strength but on the inner certainty of who he is. The stone is the focused belief that overcomes all obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob’s Stone Pillow: Turning Hardness into Vision</strong><br />
In Genesis 28:11, Jacob lays his head on a stone and dreams of a ladder reaching into heaven. This is a profound moment of transition: the stone, hard and unyielding, becomes the foundation for a divine revelation. Neville would say that even our most difficult states—our “stone pillows”—can become gateways to spiritual awakening when met with persistence and desire.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Building with Stones of Consciousness</strong><br />
To live according to the Law of Assumption is to realise that all things are built upon belief. The stones of the Bible remind us that what is fixed in consciousness becomes form. Whether you are crossing into new territory, drawing water from a hard place, or facing a giant, it is your assumption—your inner stone—that determines the outcome.</p>
