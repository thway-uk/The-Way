    <h1>The Meaning of Wisdom: Biblical Foundations and Neville Goddard’s Insights</h1>
    <p>Wisdom occupies a central place in Scripture and in the metaphysical teachings of Neville Goddard. While the Bible presents wisdom as a divine attribute—guiding right living and revealing God’s order—Neville reframes wisdom as the conscious use of imagination to craft one’s reality. This post explores the <strong>biblical meaning of wisdom</strong>, then draws out <strong>Neville Goddard’s</strong> perspective, before showing how the two converge.</p>
<hr />
<h4>1. Biblical Portraits of Wisdom</h4>
<p><strong>1.1 Wisdom Personified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 8:12–14</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.<br />
The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil; pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverse speech I hate.”<br />
Here, Wisdom speaks as a divine companion—present at creation, abhorring wickedness, and offering prudence and discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2 The Beginning of Wisdom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 9:10</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.”<br />
Wisdom begins with reverent relationship to God. It’s not mere intellectual knowledge but a heart‑attitude that honours divine truth.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.3 Wisdom’s Source</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 2:6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.”<br />
True wisdom is a gift, not self‑generated. It flows from God’s own character and purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.4 Wisdom’s Blossoming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proverbs 3:13–18</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,<br />
for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.<br />
She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.<br />
Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honour.<br />
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.”<br />
Wisdom yields enduring benefit—riches that outlast material wealth, and a path of peace and honour.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.5 New Testament Clarification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>James 3:17</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.”<br />
This “heavenly wisdom” mirrors Proverbs: it produces purity, peace, mercy and sincerity—fruit of a spirit‑led life.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Neville Goddard on Wisdom and Imagination</h4>
<p>Neville Goddard (1905–1972) taught that <strong>“imagination is God within us”</strong> and that the creative act begins in the mind. For Neville:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wisdom = Skillful Imagination</strong><br />
Wisdom is the <strong>art of directing imagination</strong> to experience the “state of the wish fulfilled.” It’s not just dreaming, but <em>feeling</em> the desired reality as already accomplished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling as Creative Fuel</strong><br />
In lectures such as <em>“Feeling Is the Secret”</em>, Neville emphasised that emotion (feeling) is the energy that drives imagination into manifestation. True wisdom lies in mastering one’s feelings to sustain the imagined state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revising Past and Present</strong><br />
Neville’s technique of <em>revision</em>—re‑imagining past events to alter one’s inner state—reflects biblical wisdom’s theme of transformation (see Romans 12:2: “be transformed by the renewal of your mind”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Law of Assumption</strong><br />
This is Neville’s shorthand for wisdom in action: assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled, persist in that assumption, and the outer world will conform.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</tbody>
</table>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverence and Assumption</strong><br />
Just as biblical wisdom begins in the fear of the Lord, Neville teaches starting in the <em>assurance</em> of the wish fulfilled—an inner reverence for one’s own divine capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wisdom as Pathway to Peace</strong><br />
Proverbs promises peace and pleasantness; Neville affirms that a disciplined imagination brings inner tranquillity and outward harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformation of Mind</strong><br />
Romans 12:2 and Neville’s revision both underscore that true wisdom involves renewing the mind—changing inner narratives to reshape experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong>, in the biblical sense, is divine instruction for right living—beginning with reverent awareness of God and yielding purity, peace, and purpose. <strong>Neville Goddard</strong> re‑interprets this wisdom as the <strong>mastery of imagination</strong>, teaching that our inner world—guided by faith, feeling, and assumption—is the soil from which every outward effect grows. Together, they invite us to honour the <strong>creative power within</strong>, to direct it wisely, and to manifest our deepest desires in alignment with divine truth.</p>
