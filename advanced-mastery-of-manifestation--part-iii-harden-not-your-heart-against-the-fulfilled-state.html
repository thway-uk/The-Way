    <h1>Advanced Mastery of Manifestation — Part III: Harden Not Your Heart Against the Fulfilled State</h1>
    <p></p><p>Consider:</p><blockquote><p>“Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called ‘today,’ that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end, while it is said,</p><p>
‘<i>Today, if you hear his voice,<br />
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.</i>’”<br />
— <em>Hebrews 3:12–15 (ESV)</em></p></blockquote><p><em></em></p><hr /><h3>✦ <strong>Reflection on “Today”</strong> ✦</h3><blockquote>
<p>The word <strong>“today”</strong> is a <strong>powerful call to immediate inner awareness</strong>.<br />
It reminds us that the <strong>present moment</strong> is the <strong>only true opportunity</strong> to respond to the quiet voice of our fulfilled imagination — the living God within.</p>
<p>This is not a time to delay or wait for external proof.</p>
<p>To <strong>embrace your assumption today</strong> is to keep your heart soft and receptive, preventing the subtle hardening of doubt or disbelief.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard calls postponement the “rebellion,” a turning away from your own creative power.</p>
<p>Manifestation begins <strong>now</strong>, not later.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Psychological Key</h4>
This passage warns of inner rebellion—when you abandon your assumption due to doubt, habit, or sensory evidence. Neville Goddard would interpret “the living God” as your own wonderful human imagination—the very awareness of being that gives life to all assumptions.<p></p><p>To “turn away” from the living God is to turn away from the truth that consciousness is the only creative power. This “God” is living because it is aware, responsive, and self-operating—it does not need to be invoked from outside, because it is the source within you that hears, sees, and becomes.</p><p>This is not a separate deity, but the life-principle animating your every assumption—your “I AM.” It is living in the sense that it becomes whatever you accept as true of yourself. To turn away from it is to return to dead cause-and-effect thinking, placing power in circumstances rather than consciousness.</p><p>The phrase “brothers and sisters” refers not to others, but to your inner faculties—those thoughts, reactions, and assumptions that move together in alignment. They are the parts of you capable of agreement or betrayal. In Neville’s terms, your “brothers” are those mental companions (inner conversations and states) that either support your assumption or draw you back into doubt.</p><p>“Hear his voice” means to become sensitive again to the inner whisper of your fulfilled state—the quiet confidence of assumption, even in the face of nothing.</p><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Manifestation Principle</h4>
The hardened heart is symbolic of disbelief solidified. When doubt becomes chronic, it corrupts the imagination. This is the psychological “rebellion”: forsaking your inner reality in favour of outer appearances.<p></p><p>To “share in Christ” is to share in imagination’s creative power. But this sharing is conditional: only if you “hold your original conviction firmly to the very end.” In other words, manifestation requires persistence in the state, even when nothing outside affirms it yet.</p><p>The deceitfulness of sin is simply this: letting appearances talk you out of your assumption.</p><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Application</h4>
Each time you feel the urge to give up on your assumption—to say “it’s not working” or “maybe it’s not meant for me”—recognise that this is the hardening of the heart. Your job is not to force the outer world, but to soften inwardly: to remain receptive, trusting, and alive to the voice of fulfilment within.<p></p><p>“Today”—not tomorrow, not once you have the evidence—“today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.” This is a call to immediate realignment.</p><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Advanced Manifestation Tip</h4>
When persistence feels heavy, remember: you are not keeping up a performance—you are resting in your true identity.<p></p><p>Say quietly:<br />
“I hear the voice of fulfilment. I do not harden my heart.”<br />
“I hold firm to my original conviction.”<br />
“It is finished.”</p><p>Rebellion is not dramatic—it’s subtle. It's the sigh, the second-guessing, the shrinking back. Return instead to the certainty that your assumption is already fact in the unseen.</p>
