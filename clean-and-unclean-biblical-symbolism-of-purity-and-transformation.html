<h1>Clean and Unclean: Biblical Symbolism of Purity and Transformation</h1>
<p>The Bible frequently uses the concepts of <em>clean</em> and <em>unclean</em> not as dietary laws or ritual regulations but as profound symbols of inner states — states of consciousness that either align with or block the manifestation of divine fulfilment.</p>
<h3><strong>Old Testament Foundations: The Law of Clean and Unclean</strong></h3>
<p>In the Old Testament, especially in books like Leviticus and Deuteronomy, God instructs the Israelites on which animals and foods are clean and unclean (Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14). At surface level, these were dietary laws intended to set Israel apart as a holy people. But Neville Goddard and many spiritual interpreters see them as metaphors for the <em>state of the inner mind</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Clean</em> food symbolises thoughts and feelings aligned with faith, hope, love, and the Law of Assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Unclean</em> food represents doubtful, fearful, or negative states — the “foods” we feed the imagination that block manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This inner cleanliness is essential for transformation and the fulfilment of one’s desires.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Jesus and the Radical Redefinition of Clean and Unclean</strong></h3>
<p>In the New Testament, Jesus challenges the external focus on clean and unclean foods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of a man, those are they that defile him.”</em><br />
— <em>Mark 7:15</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus shifts attention from external observance to internal purity. The food itself does not defile — rather, it is the <em>state of the heart and mind</em> that determines cleanness.</p>
<p>This points us toward a spiritual interpretation: the “cleanliness” required is not ritual, but psychological — a clear, uncontradicted assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Romans and the Spiritual Symbolism of Food</strong></h3>
<p>Paul’s epistle to the Romans deepens this understanding. Romans chapters 14 and 15 address <em>disputes about food and cleanliness</em> among early Christians. Paul advises tolerance but also points to the symbolic meaning of these debates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One man’s faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.”</em><br />
— <em>Romans 14:2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul is speaking metaphorically about <em>faith as the true ‘clean food’</em>. The “strong” eat freely — meaning they are fully confident in their assumption and therefore not bound by limiting beliefs or rituals. The “weak” limit themselves, reflecting doubt and separation.</p>
<p>Later, Paul says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Everything is clean for those who are clean, but for those who are stained and unbelieving, nothing is clean.”</em><br />
— <em>Titus 1:15</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This affirms that the real question is <em>inner state</em>, not external observance.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Clearing the Unclean: Inner Cleansing Through Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>To <em>clear something as clean</em> in Neville’s teaching and biblical symbolism is to remove doubt, fear, and contradiction — to feed your imagination only with what supports your fulfilled desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Food as Thought:</strong> The food you feed your mind is either clean or unclean. Thoughts of lack, fear, and limitation are unclean and defile your inner temple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cleansing as Purification:</strong> Clearing unclean food means purifying your imagination of these limiting thoughts. This is a necessary preparation for manifestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manifestation as Inner Cleanliness:</strong> You cannot manifest what you assume is dirty, impossible, or unworthy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Symbolism of the Temple and Cleanliness</strong></h3>
<p>The temple in the Bible symbolises your inner being. Just as the physical temple required ritual cleansing, so too does your consciousness require clearing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.”</em><br />
— <em>Proverbs 4:23</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your heart and mind are unclean, the “issues of life” — your experiences and manifestations — will reflect that.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Practical Application: How to Clear What Is Unclean</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Limiting Beliefs:</strong> Recognise the “unclean food” you have been feeding your imagination — fears, doubts, negative self-talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply the Law of Assumption:</strong> Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. This is the “clean food” that nourishes your inner temple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persist in Inner Purity:</strong> Like the bride preparing for the marriage supper, maintain a pure, uncontradicted state. This keeps your “clothing” clean and ready.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Affirmations and Visualization:</strong> Repeatedly immerse yourself in positive, fulfilled scenes to replace unclean mental food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Let Go of Rituals and Outer Judgments:</strong> Focus on your inner state, not external rules, to cultivate cleanness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Cleanliness as the Key to Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible’s distinction between clean and unclean is more than religious law — it is a profound metaphor for your spiritual and psychological condition. Paul’s teachings in Romans and Jesus’s radical redefinition both emphasise that <em>true purity is an inner state</em>.</p>
<p>By clearing the “unclean” from your imagination and feeding only the “clean,” you align with the Law of Assumption, making yourself ready for the manifestation of your desires.</p>
