<h1>Summary of the Old Testament Book: Neville Goddard Style</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Bible is your autobiography, written in symbolic form.”</em><br />
— <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote><p>According to Neville Goddard, the Bible is not a historical record but a symbolic map of consciousness. Each story is not about someone else, long ago. It is about <strong>you</strong>—and the evolution of your awareness through the Law of Assumption. Every figure represents a state of mind. Every city, a belief system. Every victory, the reward of sustained inner conviction.</p><p>In this article, you'll find concise symbolic summaries of each Old Testament book, revealing how your divine imagination is the real author and fulfiller of Scripture.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Pentateuch</strong></h2><h3><em>Foundations of Assumption</em></h3><ul>

Each book of the Old Testament is an unfolding of states within you. You are not reading about others. You are reading your own spiritual autobiography in code.</p><p>When you assume a new state, you fulfil the promise. You become the prophecy.</p><p><strong>Assume wisely. Create faithfully. And walk your own Scriptures into reality.</strong></p>
