<h1>Elijah: Summary Through the Eye of Neville Goddard</h1>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Bible is a psychological drama. It deals not with persons but with the states of consciousness through which the soul passes.”</em><br />
—Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote><p>The prophet Elijah is not merely a man in history. He represents the bold, inner declaration that assumption creates reality. His journey—from drought to fire to ascension—mirrors the inner path of one who awakens to their creative power and learns to persist in it.</p><hr /><h2>1. The Word That Shapes Reality</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 17:1 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“By the life of the Lord, the God of Israel, before whom I am living, there will be no dew or rain these years, but only at my word.”</em></p><p>Elijah appears and declares that <strong>only his word</strong> will open the heavens. This is the first principle: <strong>assumption comes first</strong>. The drought symbolises a barren state of consciousness—one that lacks awareness of its own power. Elijah’s word represents the creative command from within.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Elijah = The assuming self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drought = Inner barrenness; lack of imaginative awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word = Conscious decree; inner conviction</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>2. Ravens and the Brook: Faith in Invisible Supply</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 17:6 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“And the ravens came to him in the morning with bread and meat, and in the evening with bread and meat; and he took water from the stream.”</em></p><p>After the inner command, Elijah retreats. Yet he is fed—by ravens, no less—and drinks from a brook. When you rest in assumption, <strong>resources appear</strong>, even from unlikely sources. This shows that inner conviction <strong>precedes outer evidence</strong>. You need not strive; you abide.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Ravens = Unexpected channels of supply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brook = Flow of peace from resting in imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retreat = Detachment from appearances</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>3. The Widow’s Oil: Acting “As If”</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 17:14 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“For the Lord, the God of Israel, says, The store of meal will not come to an end or the vessel of oil be without more till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth.”</em></p><p>The widow has almost nothing, yet Elijah instructs her to feed him first. This symbolic act of <strong>faith in the unseen</strong> unlocks supply. Neville taught that acting as though your desire is already fulfilled opens the way. This is not performance—it is <strong>participation in the creative process</strong>.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Widow = Despairing consciousness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meal and oil = Inner substance (faith, imagination)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting “as if” = Movement into the state desired</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>4. Mount Carmel: Only Assumption Brings Fire</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 18:24 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“Then you will send up a prayer to the name of your god, and I will make prayer to the name of the Lord: and the God who gives an answer by fire, let him be God.”</em></p><p><strong>1 Kings 18:38 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“Then the fire of the Lord came down, burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the earth...”</em></p><p>The prophets of Baal exhaust themselves, yet no fire comes. Elijah calmly rebuilds the altar, drenches it with water, and fire falls. This is not magic—it is <strong>inner certainty</strong>. Fire represents manifestation. Only deep, inner conviction results in visible transformation.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Baal = Belief in external causes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire = Manifestation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Altar = Inner certainty and self-offering</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>5. The Still Small Voice: The Power in Silence</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 19:11–12 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“But the Lord was not in the wind... or in the earth-shock... or in the fire: and after the fire, the sound of a gentle breeze.”</em></p><p>Even after victory, Elijah flees. In a cave, he learns that the power is not in noise or spectacle, but in stillness. The “gentle breeze” represents the <strong>quiet assumption</strong>, the inner knowing that creates reality. Neville said creation happens in <strong>feeling</strong>, not in effort.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Cave = Deep inwardness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breeze = Quiet conviction; the felt reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earthquake, wind, fire = Drama without power</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>6. The Mantle Falls on Elisha: Identity Transfers</h2><p><strong>1 Kings 19:19 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“And Elijah went from there and came across Elisha... and Elijah put his robe on him.”</em></p><p>Elijah places his mantle—his outer identity—on Elisha. This is the transfer of state. Each time you shift from one assumption to another, you are letting go of the old identity and clothing yourself in the new. The robe is the felt identity accepted in imagination.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Elisha = The new version of self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mantle = Assumed identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passing the mantle = Shifting from one state to another</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>7. Ascension: Fixing the Assumption in the Heavens</h2><p><strong>2 Kings 2:11–13 (BBE)</strong><br />
<em>“Then there came a carriage of fire and horses of fire... and Elijah went up in a great wind into heaven.”</em></p><p>Elijah’s journey ends not in death, but in ascension. When you fix an assumption deeply within and live from it consistently, <strong>it lifts your experience</strong>. Elisha picks up the mantle, and the cycle begins again. Ascension is the final acceptance of your new state as reality.</p><p><strong>Symbolic Key</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p>Chariot of fire = Emotional power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whirlwind = Shift into higher state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heaven = Fixed, assumed reality</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2>Final Thoughts: The Psychology of Elijah</h2><p>This story is not about weather, animals, or kings—it is about <strong>your imagination</strong>. Elijah shows you how to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Speak your inner word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in confident assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act from the state you desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confront doubt with quiet conviction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift into a new self-concept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let that new self lift you</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each step in Elijah’s story reflects a phase in the process of manifestation, just as Neville Goddard described it. When you read Elijah symbolically, you are not reading about a prophet—you are recognising the power of <strong>your own awareness</strong>.</p>
