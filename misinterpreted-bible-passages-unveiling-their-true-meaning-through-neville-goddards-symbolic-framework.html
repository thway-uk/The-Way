    <h1>Misinterpreted Bible Passages: Unveiling Their True Meaning Through Neville Goddard’s Symbolic Framework</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard taught that every story, law and figure in Scripture is the symbolic language of consciousness.  In his view, the man-figures represent our conscious mind—the part that wills, decides and imagines—and the women-figures represent our subconscious—the part that faithfully brings to life whatever the conscious mind assumes.  When we apply the Law of Assumption to these passages, we see that what the Bible “commands” is not a set of external rules but a description of how thought becomes reality.</p>
<p>Below we re-read six frequently misused texts purely through this lens of conscious and subconscious interaction.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Leviticus 18:22; 20:13 – “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Condemnation of same-sex love.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> These verses describe the misuse of imagination when the conscious mind (man) wrongfully assumes it must limit the subconscious (woman).  The real command is: “Do not impose restrictive beliefs on your subconscious.”  Whenever the conscious self assumes that love and creativity can be restricted by outward forms, the subconscious obeys and brings limitation into experience.  Instead, assume that love is unlimited—and your subconscious will manifest freedom, acceptance and unity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 – “Let your women keep silence in the churches”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Silencing of women’s voices.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> This admonition describes the moment when the conscious mind must pause its chattering and impress a clear assumption upon the silent subconscious.  The women (subconscious) are not truly silent; they are listening for the one clear assumption to fulfil.  If the conscious mind continually interrupts itself with doubt and confusion, the subconscious cannot act.  The lesson: cultivate a single, powerful assumption—then let your subconscious work its creative magic in perfect silence.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Romans 1:26-27 – “God gave them up to dishonourable passions”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Judgment of sexual orientation.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> “God” here is your own subconscious reflecting back the conscious assumptions you hold.  When the conscious mind assumes separation, shame or fear, the subconscious “gives you up” to exactly that inner state—bringing discordant experiences as proof of your own limiting beliefs.  To change the reflection, change the assumption: dwell in the feeling of unity, love and self-acceptance, and the subconscious will return images and experiences that match.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. Matthew 7:13-14 – “The gate is narrow… few find it”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Exclusion from salvation.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> The narrow gate is the precise moment when a conscious assumption must slip through the subconscious barrier of old beliefs.  It is narrow because we resist new, expansive assumptions.  Only when the conscious mind insists—no matter how small the door may seem—and pushes its new assumption through, will the subconscious admit it and reconstruct reality accordingly.  The “few” are simply those who persevere in that single assumption.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. John 14:6 – “I am the way, the truth, and the life”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Religious exclusivity.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> “I” is the conscious “I AM” that assumes an identity.  This verse is the declaration of the Law of Assumption itself: the conscious “I AM” is the creative power that directs the subconscious.  When you assume “I AM loved,” “I AM free,” or “I AM whole,” the subconscious moves to manifest those truths.  There is no other “way” beyond the conscious assumption of your desired state.</p>
<hr />
<h2>6. Exodus 21:20-21 – “If a man strikes his servant…”</h2>
<p><strong>Literal abuse:</strong> Justification of slavery.<br />
<strong>Symbolic truth:</strong> The servant is the subconscious mind being “struck” by conflicting assumptions.  If the conscious mind alternately beats the subconscious with doubt and hope, the subconscious becomes “bruised” and confused—bringing pain into life.  The Bible’s real injunction is to treat your subconscious with consistency and respect: hold a single, positive assumption and watch your servant mind transform your world without suffering.</p>
<hr />
<h3>In Summary</h3>
<p>Every command and story in Scripture describes the dance between your conscious assumptions (the men) and your creative subconscious (the women).  When you understand that “the kingdom of God is within,” you see that every “law” is really an explanation of how to use your imagination.  Assume only what you wish to see, maintain that assumption—as narrowly or boldly as needed—and your subconscious will shape your outer world to match.</p>
