    <h1>Leviticus Law, Adam and Eve,  and Nakedness</h1>
    <p>The Bible, often seen as a collection of moral codes, reveals profound psychological and metaphysical truths when viewed through Neville Goddard's teachings. Through his principle that <em>"Imagination creates reality,"</em> we unlock layers of deeper meaning—guiding us to understand consciousness and the nature of creation.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore a passage from <strong>Leviticus</strong> about incestuous relationships and how it serves as a metaphor for mental boundaries within our consciousness. We’ll contrast these external rules with Goddard’s direct path to manifestation, rooted in the “state of Jesus.” Along the way, we’ll interpret the symbolic meanings of figures like the <strong>father, mother, and sister</strong> as they relate to our inner world.</p><p><strong>Leviticus</strong> comes from the Latin <em>Leviticus</em>, meaning "of the Levites," referring to the tribe responsible for temple service. Symbolically, it represents spiritual purification, the removal of limiting beliefs, and aligning with divine order. It serves as a metaphor for inner transformation and the steps toward a higher state of consciousness.</p><h3>Adam and Eve: The Fall and the State of Nakedness</h3><p>The story of <strong>Adam and Eve</strong> in the Garden of Eden begins with innocence and divine wholeness. They were naked, yet unashamed, symbolising a state of effortless creation and unity with their divine nature. However, after their fall, they became aware of their nakedness, which represents a shift from a state of unity to a state of vulnerability and lack. This “nakedness” reflects the transition from complete divine alignment to the awareness of separation and limitation within the consciousness.</p><p>This shift mirrors what we find in <strong>Leviticus</strong>—the symbolic meaning of "uncovering nakedness" resonates deeply within our psyche, representing the mental patterns that hinder our creative power.</p><hr /><h3>Leviticus: Literal Laws and Metaphysical Truths</h3><p>In <strong>Leviticus 18</strong>, we encounter a series of laws prohibiting sexual relations with close relatives, such as:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or mother"</strong> (Lev 18:7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife"</strong> (Lev 18:8)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At face value, these are external prohibitions meant to govern societal behaviour. However, through Neville Goddard's lens, these laws can be interpreted as metaphors for the mental boundaries that govern our consciousness. They offer a framework that seeks to control our internal state but fall short of directly transforming it.</p><p>While <strong>Leviticus</strong> uses external rules to manage behaviour, <strong>Goddard</strong> teaches a more direct method of transformation—through the <strong>power of assumption</strong>. Manifestation, according to Goddard, happens when we embody the feeling of the wish fulfilled, creating reality from within, without relying on external constraints.</p><hr /><h3>From Legal Boundaries to Christ Consciousness</h3><p>Leviticus’ legalistic structure can be viewed as an attempt to shape consciousness through external boundaries. These laws served a purpose in guiding early societies but do not lead to true transformation. In contrast, Goddard's teachings invite us to go beyond external limitations and embrace a more direct path to manifestation: the <strong>state of Jesus</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>state of Jesus</strong> represents divine wholeness, where we align with the inner feeling of the wish fulfilled. It is the embodiment of our creative power, rooted not in external rules, but in an internal knowing that our thoughts and assumptions are the true creators of our reality.</p><p>Where Leviticus shapes behaviour through restriction, Goddard teaches that true manifestation occurs when we move beyond such limitations and fully assume the desired state from within.</p><hr /><h3>The Inner “Family” and the Power of Assumption: The State of Nakedness After the Fall</h3><p>In <strong>Goddard's framework</strong>, the story of Adam and Eve’s fall is a psychological allegory. Their nakedness after the fall symbolises the loss of divine wholeness and the awareness of separation. In this state, we focus on perceived lack, which hinders our ability to manifest.</p><p>Similarly, Leviticus' prohibition on "uncovering nakedness" symbolises dwelling in the post-fall state of separation and limitation. Let’s break down the symbolic meanings of the “relatives” in <strong>Leviticus</strong>, which represent different aspects of our inner consciousness:</p><hr /><h3>Symbolic Interpretations of “Relatives” in Leviticus</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Close Relatives</strong>: These represent deeply ingrained mental patterns, assumptions, and beliefs. "Uncovering their nakedness" suggests dwelling on habitual thoughts that reflect perceived lack or limitation, mirroring Adam and Eve’s newfound awareness of their vulnerability after the fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Father</strong>: Symbolises our core sense of I AM—our awareness of being. To "uncover his nakedness" could represent identifying with a limited or fragmented awareness of ourselves, just as Adam felt separate from his divine source after the fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: Represents the subconscious mind, the fertile ground for creation. "Uncovering her nakedness" suggests accepting the belief that our subconscious is barren or incapable of manifesting our desires, mirroring the struggle for fulfilment post-fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Father’s Wife (In-Law to the I AM)</strong>: Symbolises beliefs adopted from external sources, beliefs that reinforce separation and limitation. "Uncovering her nakedness" means internalising these external beliefs, which further reinforce a fragmented state of consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sister</strong>: Represents different aspects of our own consciousness. "Uncovering her nakedness" reflects focusing on perceived lack or incompleteness within ourselves, reinforcing the internal fragmentation that emerged after the fall.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>Beyond Law: The State of Jesus—Reclaiming Divine Wholeness</h3><p>While <strong>Leviticus</strong> seeks to regulate behaviour through external laws, <strong>Goddard</strong> points us toward the more direct method of manifestation: the <strong>state of Jesus</strong>. This state represents divine wholeness, where the individual realises their creative power and manifests reality effortlessly by embodying the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><p>Instead of relying on external rules, the <strong>state of Jesus</strong> invites us to transcend limitations and consciously assume the state of divine wholeness. In this state, manifestation becomes effortless, as we fully align with the belief that our desires are already fulfilled.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: Creating from Divine Wholeness</h3><p>Leviticus presents an early attempt to manage consciousness through external rules, but true transformation comes through internal alignment with divine wholeness. The “uncovering of nakedness” is not about physical relations, but about the awareness of lack and separation within our consciousness.</p><p>The path to successful manifestation lies not in following external laws but in embodying the <strong>state of Jesus</strong>—the state of divine wholeness. Through <strong>assumption</strong>, we can create effortlessly, just as Jesus did, by aligning with our true divine nature. By consciously choosing the thoughts and assumptions we live by, we take command of our creative power and manifest a reality that reflects our divine potential.</p><hr /><p>


































</p><p>By embracing the <strong>power of assumption</strong> and rejecting beliefs that reinforce limitation, we can move beyond the need for external rules, creating a harmonious inner world and manifesting our desires with ease.</p>
