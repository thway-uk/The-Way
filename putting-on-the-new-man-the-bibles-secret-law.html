<h1>Putting on the New Man: The Bible’s Secret Law</h1>
<p>The Bible is not a religious rulebook. It is a psychological and spiritual document — a manual of <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>. Beneath the surface narrative, it reveals one powerful principle: the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>.</p><p>This law teaches that what you assume to be true — what you accept in imagination as reality — will externalise itself in your world. The Bible is not concerned with religious duties or moral codes. It speaks instead to the inner drama of <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, the movement of awareness, and the transformation of self through assumption.</p><hr /><h3>Created in the Image of Consciousness</h3><p>We begin in Genesis 1:26:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This doesn’t describe a physical form. “Image” and “likeness” refer to states of consciousness — <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a> was created to reflect the creative nature of God, which is <strong>Imagination</strong> itself.</p><p>The “<a href="/p/elohim-god.html">us</a>” is not a group of divine beings, but the inner faculties — the <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">judges, rulers, and thought-forms that together</a> make up <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man’s identity</a>. These inner components — belief, memory, desire, and feeling — gather in agreement to form what one accepts as true.</p><p>Paul confirms this principle in <strong>Ephesians 4:22–24</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Put off the old <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a>… and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, which after God is created…”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>And again in <strong>Colossians 3:9–10</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You have put off the old <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">self</a>… and put on the new <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">self</a>, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not poetry. It is psychological instruction: <strong>Let go of the self you believe yourself to be, and assume the state of the one you desire to become.</strong></p><hr /><h3>Jacob and Esau: Two States Within One Man</h3><p>This <a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">principle is dramatised</a> in <strong>Genesis 27</strong>, when <strong>Jacob</strong> receives the blessing meant for <strong>Esau</strong>.</p><p>Esau represents the outer <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a> — the physical self, the reactive identity shaped by the past.<br />
Jacob represents the inner <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">self</a> — the imaginative, spiritual identity that dares to assume.</p><p>To receive the blessing, Jacob puts on Esau’s garments and covers himself with hair. But this is not mere disguise — it is the outer enactment of inner assumption. Jacob doesn't wait to change; he dresses as the version of himself who is already blessed.</p><hr /><h3>Isaac: The Law of Assumption in Action</h3><p>Here, Isaac plays a vital and often misunderstood role.</p><p>According to Paul, <strong>Isaac is the child of promise</strong> — the result of <em>faith, not flesh</em> (Galatians 4:23). He is the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong> embodied — the principle that blesses belief over appearance.</p><p>Within Isaac dwell two sons — <strong>two inner states</strong>. Esau is the natural self, and <a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">Jacob</a> is the new identity claimed in imagination. When Jacob approaches, Isaac declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”</em> — <em>Genesis 27:22</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the moment of inner contradiction: the external still looks like the old man, but the inner speech has changed. Isaac chooses not by lineage or fact, but by <strong>what is presented in faith</strong> — Jacob’s assumption.</p><p>Paul expands this truth in <strong>Romans 9:10–13</strong>, saying that <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a> chose Jacob before either had done good or evil — to show that it is not by works, but by <strong>election</strong> — by the <em>state chosen within</em>.</p><p><a href="/2025/07/esau-and-jacob-isaacs-blessing.html">Isaac, as the Law in motion</a>, responds to the inner conviction. Once the assumption is accepted, he cannot reverse it:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I have blessed him — and he shall be blessed.”</em> — <em>Genesis 27:33</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>From Natural to Spiritual: The Inner Journey</h3><p>Paul outlines the deeper structure of this transformation in <strong>1 Corinthians 15:44–47</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body... The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The <strong>natural body</strong> is Esau — the default self, defined by reaction and habit.<br />
The <strong>spiritual body</strong> is Jacob — the self assumed, which gives life through imagination.</p><p>The progression is always the same: from outer to inner, from flesh to spirit, from fact to faith.</p><p>The Bible’s message is not “Obey God out there.” It is: <strong>Recognise yourself as a creative being, and put on the state you desire — inwardly — until it becomes your world.</strong></p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Bible Is a Record of Assumption</h3><p>When read through the lens of <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">consciousness</a>, the Bible becomes a guide for internal transformation. It is the story of identity moving between forms — the “old man” being replaced by the “new,” the Esau by the Jacob, the natural by the spiritual.</p><p>Over and over, characters assume new names, new garments, and new realities — and are blessed not for what they were, but for <strong>what they believed themselves to be.</strong></p><p>Whether it’s Jacob stepping into Esau’s role, Paul urging us to “put on Christ,” or Adam giving way to the life-giving man of heaven — the message is one:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>What you assume, you become. What you wear inwardly, the world confirms outwardly.</strong></p></blockquote>
