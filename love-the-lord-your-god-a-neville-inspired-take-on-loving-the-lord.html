    <h1>"Love the Lord Your God": A Neville-Inspired Take on Loving the Lord</h1>
    <p>When Scripture says, <em>“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength”</em> (Mark 12:30), Neville Goddard would not point outward to a distant deity. Instead, he’d turn us inward, to the “Lord” as our own I AM—the core of consciousness itself.</p>
<p>To love the Lord with <em>all your heart</em> is to give full emotional conviction to the reality of your desire. With <em>all your soul</em> means to fully surrender the old self-image and animate the new one. With <em>all your mind</em> is to mentally dwell in the end, living from the state already fulfilled. And with <em>all your strength</em>? That’s persistence—remaining loyal to the unseen reality no matter what the outer world shows.</p>
<p>For Neville, this command isn’t about religion. It’s about full alignment. Total fidelity to your imagined ideal. It’s not just believing in God—it’s <em>being</em> God in action.</p>
