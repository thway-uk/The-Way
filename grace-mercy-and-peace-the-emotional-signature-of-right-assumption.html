<h1>Grace, Mercy, and Peace: The Emotional Signature of Right Assumption</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <em>feeling is the secret</em>. When you have truly assumed the state of the wish fulfilled—when you feel that you <strong>have already received</strong>—there is a natural shift in emotion. You no longer reach, plead, or strive. Instead, you experience <em>relief</em>, <em>gratitude</em>, and a settled joy.</p><p>This emotional atmosphere is consistently reflected in the Bible through the repeated blessing: <strong>grace, mercy, and peace</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Not Just Words—Spiritual Indicators</strong></h3><p>These three words are not mere pleasantries. They are spiritual indicators of a correct inner stance. And significantly, they appear in Scripture not as requests, but as <em>givens</em>—as natural outcomes of divine presence.</p><p>In the language of Neville, they describe the emotional signature of the state where the <strong>I AM</strong> is rightly placed.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Grace: The Effortless Flow</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.”</em><br />
— <strong>2 Corinthians 13:14</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Grace is the ease and flow that comes when you stop struggling to make something happen and accept that it already has.</p><p>In Neville’s understanding:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Grace</em> is the natural result of dwelling in your chosen state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Love</em> is the felt union with your fulfilled desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Communion</em> with the Holy Spirit is the alignment of your imagination with what you have claimed as true.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>Mercy: Compassion Toward the Self</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us…”</em><br />
— <strong>Ephesians 2:4</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Mercy is the kindness you extend to yourself—releasing regret, guilt, or self-judgement about past states or delays.</p><p>Neville taught that “God” is your own wonderful human imagination. So, <em>mercy</em> is not granted by a distant power—it is the permission your “I AM” gives to shift identity without punishment. You are never condemned for being in the wrong state; you are simply invited to move.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Peace: The Stillness of Knowing</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”</em><br />
— <strong>John 14:27</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Peace is the absence of effort. The end is accepted. You know it is done—even if nothing has yet changed on the outside.</p><p>This is not the peace that comes <em>after</em> success. It is the peace that <em>precedes</em> it—because in imagination, you have already succeeded. It is the peace of being one with the fulfilled desire.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Emotional Evidence of Assumption</strong></h3><p>Scripture opens many of its epistles with these three words—<strong>grace, mercy, and peace</strong>—suggesting they are not just virtues but <em>emotional confirmations</em> of inner alignment.</p><p>They are how you know the assumption has been made rightly.<br />
They are what it feels like to dwell in the end.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>If you feel tension, frustration, or irritation, these are signs that the assumption has not yet been fully accepted.</strong><br />
They signal effort instead of faith—resistance instead of rest.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>The Mark of a Right Assumption</strong></h3><p>Right assumption always produces <em>emotional evidence</em>. You don’t wonder if it worked—you <strong>feel</strong> it.</p><p>Grace, mercy, and peace arise naturally when you inhabit the desired state.<br />
To feel them is to know: <em>you are dwelling rightly</em>.</p>
