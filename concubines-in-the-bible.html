<h1>Concubines in the Bible</h1>
And no—this isn’t your Margaret Atwood dystopia -The Handmaids Tale. We’re diving into something far more inwardly dramatic: the symbolic use of concubines in the spiritual psychology of the Bible, as revealed by Neville Goddard.
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Core Symbolism</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is not a historical account but a psychological blueprint—every character and event unfolding within the mind of the individual. Within this metaphysical framework, <strong>concubines</strong> represent something quietly potent: <strong>fragmented desires</strong>, <strong>secondary manifestations</strong>, and efforts of the imagination that are not wholly aligned with faith.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">wife—who symbolises full union between imagination and belief</a>—the concubine is an image of <strong>partial acceptance</strong>, <strong>outer effort</strong>, or <strong>doubt-ridden creation</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hagar and the Perils of Forcing the Promise</strong></h3>
<p>Sarah giving her handmaid Hagar to Abraham (Genesis 16) is often seen as desperation, but in symbolic terms, it represents <strong>the attempt to bring forth a desire through human planning rather than divine assumption</strong>. Hagar conceives Ishmael, but the true child of promise—Isaac—is only born when Sarah herself embraces faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ishmael</strong> = manifestation born of anxiety, impatience, or external effort<br />
<strong>Isaac</strong> = manifestation born of fulfilled inner conviction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville's language: Ishmael is what you get when you try to force reality to bend without first entering the state of the wish fulfilled.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Children of the Concubines: The Offspring of Divided Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout the Bible, concubines bear children who are recorded but not central to the divine narrative. These offspring symbolise <strong>outer results</strong> of inner fragmentation—manifestations that come from states of worry, need, or double-mindedness. They are real, but not aligned with the higher thread of transformation.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Solomon’s Fall: Desire Scattered Across a Thousand Attachments</strong></h3>
<p>King Solomon, the epitome of wisdom, ultimately loses his spiritual footing through his many wives and concubines (1 Kings 11). In symbolic terms, this represents a <strong>once-clear consciousness</strong> now <strong>scattered across many desires</strong>, beliefs, and foreign attachments.</p>
<p>When imagination no longer holds its aim, the kingdom of self falters. Even wisdom cannot replace the power of a focused, unified assumption.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Wife vs. Concubine: Full Assumption vs. Fragmented Belief</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">symbolic wife</a>—like Mary, the mother of Jesus—represents <strong>complete surrender to the divine idea</strong>. She says, <em>“Be it unto me according to thy word.”</em> This is the creative act in its highest form: imagining the end and fully inhabiting it.</p>
<p>The concubine, by contrast, reflects the state of <em>almost believing</em>—of <strong>going through the motions</strong> without embodying the inner transformation.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Final Thought: Creating from Wholeness</strong></h3>
<p>In the language of manifestation, <strong>concubines are the side-projects of a mind not yet centred in its aim</strong>. Neville teaches that all things are brought forth by imagination—but only that which is assumed and felt with full faith is born as a true promise fulfilled.</p>
<p>The stories of concubines remind us to check where we’re creating from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Am I acting from fear or faith?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is this desire whole, or is it scattered across doubts?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Am I the wife to my vision—or merely a concubine to my wishful thinking?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because in this inner drama, the true heir always comes from the union of belief and imagination—not from the schemes of impatience.</p>
