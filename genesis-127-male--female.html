    <h1>Genesis 1:27: MALE — FEMALE</h1>
    <p><em></em></p><blockquote>"And God made <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> in his image, in the image of God he made him: male and female he made them"</blockquote><p></p>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left;">This verse reveals the essence of <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self-creation</a> through imagination — the core principle of Neville’s Law of Assumption, which teaches that <strong>what you assume to be true in your consciousness manifests as your reality</strong>.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“God created man in his own image”</strong> signifies that <strong>man is a reflection of divine awareness within himself</strong> — the “I AM” presence imagining and defining who he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To <em>create</em> here means to <strong>assume an identity in the imagination</strong>; you “create” yourself by assuming a particular state of being internally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phrase <strong>“male and female he created them”</strong> reflects the dual nature of consciousness — active and receptive, masculine and feminine qualities within the self — symbolising the complete spectrum of inner awareness needed for creation. It also suggests that these qualities coexist within every individual as aspects of their assumed identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, <em><a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a></em> is not a fixed physical form but the <strong>living, imaginal identity assumed and sustained by the mind</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this verse teaches that your true “creation” is the identity you imagine and assume within. You are the conscious creator of your experience, shaping your reality by the assumptions you hold.</p>
