    <h1>What Does “Holy” Really Mean?</h1>
    <p>We hear the word <strong>“holy”</strong> constantly in spiritual texts and traditions—<strong>holy ground, Holy Spirit, holy people</strong>—but what does it actually mean? Is it about moral purity? Sacred rituals? Or is there something deeper that we’re being invited to see?</p>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, the word <em>holy</em> is far more <strong>experiential</strong> than institutional. It is not about being “better than,” but about being <strong>set apart through awareness</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Etymology of Holy: “Whole” and “Set Apart”</strong></h2>
<p>The English word <strong>holy</strong> stems from the Old English <em>hālig</em>, which is linked to the word <em>whole</em>.<br />
To be holy, then, is to be <strong>complete</strong>, <strong>undivided</strong>, <strong>integrated</strong>.</p>
<p>In Hebrew, the word is <strong>קָדוֹשׁ (kadosh)</strong>, meaning “set apart,” “dedicated,” or “consecrated.”<br />
It doesn’t refer to moral perfection, but to <strong>a state separated unto purpose</strong>, marked out for divine function.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Holiness and Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville’s teachings, everything is a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>. If something is <em>holy</em>, it means it is set apart in <strong>your awareness</strong> as a state that is <strong>aligned with the divine imagination</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy ground</strong> is not a location; it is the moment when your awareness shifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A holy person</strong> is one who has awakened to their union with “I AM”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To be holy</strong> is to <strong>dwell in a state of inner wholeness</strong>, where nothing is missing, nothing is broken.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Holiness Is Not Earned – It Is Recognised</strong></h2>
<p>Neville would remind us: <em>You are already holy the moment you recognise yourself as the “I AM.”</em><br />
Holiness, then, is not a reward for good behaviour, but the <strong>realisation</strong> of your oneness with the Divine.</p>
<p>To declare something as holy is to bring it into focus as <strong>spiritually real</strong>—to see it not through the eyes of the world, but through the <strong>eye of imagination</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Holy as a State of Creative Power</strong></h2>
<p>What if <em>holy</em> doesn’t mean fragile, distant, or unreachable—but rather <strong>potent</strong>?</p>
<p>When Moses turns aside to see the burning bush, he hears the voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Take off your sandals, for the place where you stand is holy ground.”</em> (Exodus 3:5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is the ground holy? Because <strong>awareness has shifted</strong>.<br />
Moses’ perception is no longer fixed on the outer world—he now communes with the <strong>I AM within</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Holiness is presence. Holiness is awareness. Holiness is creative power consciously engaged.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>To Be Holy Is to Know You Are Whole</strong></h2>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Holy</strong> = whole, set apart, aligned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not about exclusion, but <strong>elevation in consciousness</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You enter holiness the moment you realise <strong>nothing is lacking</strong>, and everything is <strong>within you</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Closing Thought</strong></h2>
<p>You don’t become holy by distance from the world—you become holy by <strong>redefining the world through the imagination</strong>.<br />
You sanctify life not by separation, but by realisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be ye holy, for I am holy.”<br />
— <em>Recognise yourself as the ‘I AM’ and you are already set apart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
