    <h1>Laban: Controlling Established Mindset</h1>
    <blockquote><p><em>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”</em> — <strong>Genesis 2:24</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This verse is not about physical marriage. It <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">expresses a spiritual law</a>—the inner <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a> (consciousness) must leave behind inherited, habitual states of mind (“father and mother”) and fully unite with a <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">new imaginal reality</a> (“the wife”) in order to become one with it.</p><p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible dramatises these inner processes. To manifest, you must abandon the known, leave the logic of the senses, and become one with the unseen. Nowhere is this more vividly expressed than in the story of Jacob and Laban, and later in the story of <a href="/2025/04/exploring-symbolism-of-nabal-abigail.html">Nabal—the <b><i>Fool</i></b></a>—whose name is a letter-reversal of Laban.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2><strong>Laban: The Old Order That Must Be Left Behind</strong></h2><p>Laban represents the stubborn order of the external world—the first-born pattern that insists things must unfold in visible, logical, linear ways. His deception—giving Leah before Rachel—illustrates this insistence:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“It is not our custom to give the younger before the older.”</em> — <strong>Genesis 29:26</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This is not just cultural; it’s symbolic.</p><p>Laban is the resistance that says the seen must come before the unseen. He is the internal voice that says you must first fix everything, forget the past, or earn the reward before you can receive your desire.</p><p>But Scripture reveals a different order.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Divine Reversal Is Divine Order</strong></h2><blockquote>
<p><em>“So the last shall be first, and the first last…”</em> — <strong>Matthew 20:16</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>The divine pattern is not chronological; it is imaginal.</p><p>Throughout Scripture, the younger—the inner, the imagined, the last—always rises above the elder:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Esau and Jacob</strong> – The seen must yield to the unseen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leah and Rachel</strong> – The imposed must give way to the beloved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim</strong> – Forgetting follows fruitfulness, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adam and Jesus</strong> – The natural man gives way to the spiritual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul and David</strong> – The tall, outwardly impressive state is replaced by the inward heart of a king.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This isn’t about injustice or preference.<br />
It is divine structure.</p><p>It shows that life is governed not by linear progression, but by spiritual assumption. God’s law honours what comes from within, not what appears first.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Jacob: The Journey of the Inner Man</strong></h2><p><a href="/p/teachers-fathers-of-law-assumption.html">Jacob</a>, whose name means “supplanter,” represents the inner man—the one who dares to persist in imagination, <a href="/2025/05/jacob-how-to-manifest-according-to-bible.html">wrestles</a> with the unseen, and holds fast to his desire until it blesses him.</p><p>Jacob’s labour under Laban symbolises the work required to maintain the end in mind while the old order tries to reassert itself. Laban continually changes Jacob’s wages and delays his promise, just as the old mindset manipulates your perception to keep you in cycles of striving without fulfilment.</p><p>But Jacob leaves.</p><p>And this departure is everything.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Jacob fled with all that he had… and stole away unawares to Laban.”</em> — <strong>Genesis 31:20</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Jacob’s flight from Laban is a spiritual decision—to abandon the subconscious allegiance to the old way, and to align fully with the new imagined end.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Rachel: The Desired State of Being</strong></h2><p><a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html">Rachel</a>, the younger and beloved, symbolises the receptivity to the new imagined state—the fulfilled desire, the end you’ve chosen. To become “<a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">one flesh</a>” with Rachel is to become completely identified with that desire, so that the inner and outer are in harmony.</p><p>But Rachel cannot be received while you remain loyal to Laban.</p><p>First, the old pattern must be recognised and decisively left behind.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Pattern Across Scripture</strong></h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Esau and Jacob:</strong> The five senses (Esau) must yield to imagination (Jacob).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim:</strong> Forgetting does not come before fruitfulness. Assume the end, and the rest will follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joseph and Benjamin:</strong> The thing you treasure most is the thing that appears last—but is always present within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus:</strong> The world’s last is God’s first. The crucifixion shows the fixing of the imaginal act before the world sees its result.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2><strong>Living in the End: Neville’s Interpretation</strong></h2><p>Neville Goddard revealed that this reversal is the key to manifestation.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“To be transformed, the whole basis of your thought must change. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and continue feeling that it is fulfilled until that which you feel objectifies itself.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The divine order is not about logic—it is about faith in imagination.</p><p>To live in the end is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Leave behind Laban’s demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refuse to wait on Leah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bless Ephraim over Manasseh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrestle until you are named.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love Rachel now, not later.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2><strong>Conclusion: Leave Laban, Embrace the End</strong></h2><p>The story of Jacob and Laban is not ancient history—it is a spiritual pattern. To manifest, you must leave the strict patterns of the past, break allegiance with appearances, and dare to become one with your unseen desire.</p>
