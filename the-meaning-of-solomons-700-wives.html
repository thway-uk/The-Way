    <h1>The Meaning of Solomon’s 700 Wives</h1>
    <p></p><blockquote>"He had seven hundred wives, daughters of kings, and three hundred other wives; and through his wives his heart was turned away."</blockquote><p></p><p>When we read in <strong>1 Kings 11:3</strong> that King Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines, it’s easy to take it as a literal fact. Yet, through Neville Goddard’s teaching and biblical number symbolism, these figures reveal a deeper truth about imagination and the creative assumptions we unite with inside ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage as Spiritual Union: Genesis 2:24</strong></p>Solomon’s wives symbolise joyful unions with various states of imagination, each representing a creative assumption within the mind. This is the success defined in Genesis. <p>Genesis 2:24 says:<br />
<em></em></p><blockquote><em>"Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."</em></blockquote><p></p>
<p>This verse is about a <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">imaginative union</a>—leaving behind old beliefs and conditioning (“father and mother”) to join fully with new delightful assumptions (“wife”) and become one creative force. This union is the foundation of manifestation: consciousness becoming inseparable from imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Number Symbolism: 700 Wives</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew number symbolism</a>, the number <strong>seven</strong> represents <i>completeness, rest, and perfection, </i>first voiced in the<a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html"> Genesis seven days of creation</a>. Solomon’s 700 wives multiply this idea of completeness—700 is 7 times 100, meaning a <em>vast and multiplied fullness</em> of states. The wives symbolise the many delightful and creative assumptions or imaginal states we “marry” or accept inside our consciousness.</p>
<p>Each wife is a unique union with a particular assumption, a state of mind we rest in and through which we create our experience. The number 700 suggests embracing imagination in a comprehensive and complete way, resting in a rich diversity of empowering beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Mastery and Warning</strong></p>
<p>Solomon’s wisdom lay in mastering these inner states. However, the Bible’s warning that his wives “led him astray” reflects how conflicting or negative assumptions can disrupt our creative power and lead to inner confusion.</p>
<p><strong>The Creative Marriage</strong></p>
<p>Following Genesis 2:24, true manifestation happens when we consciously “leave” old conditioning and become one with our chosen imaginal states—our “wives.” This sacred marriage with imagination is the key to creating the reality we desire and finding inner fulfilment.</p>
