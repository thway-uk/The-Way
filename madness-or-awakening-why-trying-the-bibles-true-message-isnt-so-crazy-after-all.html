    <h1>“Madness” or Awakening? Why Trying the Bible’s True Message Isn’t So Crazy After All</h1>
    <p>There’s a moment in the journey of self-discovery when you realise: to most people, what you’re doing looks completely mad.</p>
<p>You’re reading the Bible not as a history book or a rulebook, but as a coded invitation to transform your inner world. You’re using imagination—not effort, not hustle—as your primary creative power. You’re assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled, and expecting the world to conform.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>But let’s be honest: the Bible has been with humanity for thousands of years. It’s the most printed, debated, quoted, and yet—somehow—misunderstood text in existence. If it's <em>that</em> enduring, would it not be foolish to dismiss its deeper message without at least trying to live it?</p>
<p>Neville Goddard certainly thought so. To many, he probably <em>did</em> seem like a madman. He dared to declare that “God and your own wonderful human imagination are one.” He didn’t ask for blind belief—he challenged us to <em>test</em> it. To live as if the Bible’s metaphors and parables were instructions for reconditioning the self.</p>
<p>And when you strip away the religious trappings, what do you find? A repeated, unwavering call to shift states:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Let the weak say, I am strong.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t surface spirituality. It’s radical inner surgery.</p>
<p>The backlash comes, of course. People don’t like it when you move away from the beaten path—especially when that path is paved with centuries of tradition. But Neville wasn’t rejecting the Bible. He was peeling it open. He read it with symbolic insight, and found that it isn’t about what <em>was</em>, but what <em>is</em>—within you.</p>
<p>So if following that inner voice makes you appear a little mad—so be it. If stepping into the role of creator rather than passive observer draws criticism—let it. Because in a world where most are living by habit, fear, and repetition, choosing to imagine boldly, consciously, and reverently isn’t madness. It’s awakening.</p>
