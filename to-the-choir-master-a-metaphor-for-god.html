But when read through the deeper symbolic understanding taught by Neville Goddard, it reveals something intimate: it is not a note to an external temple musician, but a spiritual instruction directed within.</p><p></p><blockquote>"If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a sounding brass, or a clashing cymbal." — 1 Corinthians 13:1</blockquote><p></p>
<p>The choir master represents the inner conductor — the ordering principle in your mind that brings all thoughts and feelings into harmony. This inner conductor is none other than <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html"><em>Elohim</em> — the plural “gods,” “rulers,” “judges,” and “mighty ones” within you</a>. According to Strong’s Concordance, <em>Elohim</em> is a plural noun that points to the many forces within consciousness: your assumptions, moods, and self-concepts.</p>
<p>Neville taught that <em>Elohim —  <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> — </em>is not an external god but your own imagination in action. You are the ruler of your inner states; the judge passing verdict on what is true for you. Just as a choir master guides each voice into a single, harmonious song, so <em>Elohim</em> — your imagination — gathers all inner voices and directs them toward a unified expression.</p>
<p>When a Psalm is addressed “To the choir master,” it is really a call to direct your deepest songs — your prayers, affirmations, and feelings — to the ruling imagination within. It is a reminder to bring every wandering thought and scattered desire under the rule of the <em>Elohim</em> in you, the divine creative faculty.</p>
<p>In this light, your imagination is not a passive daydream but the very judge and ruler shaping your world. The many voices within — fears, hopes, desires, beliefs — are like a choir waiting for your command. When harmonised under the guidance of your inner <em>Elohim</em>, these voices produce the beautiful music of a life deliberately shaped.</p>
<p>So the next time you read, “To the choir master,” see it as an invitation: direct your inner song to the imaginative power that rules your reality. In doing so, you step into your true role as the living <em>Elohim</em>, conductor of the great choir of your mind.</p>
