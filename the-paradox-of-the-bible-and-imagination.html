    <h1>The Paradox of the Bible and Imagination</h1>
    <p>It’s a strange and painful paradox: the Bible, when interpreted symbolically, teaches that imagination — when used rightly — is the creative power of God in man. Yet for centuries, a literal reading has led people to imagine lives filled with guilt, fear, and suffering.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard reminded us that the Bible isn’t a history book, but a psychological drama. Its characters and stories reveal how states of consciousness shape our reality. Used with love and intention, imagination becomes the seed of beautiful manifestations. But when shaped by fear-based doctrines, imagination turns inward — and begins to create the very suffering we’re told to fear.</p>
<p>Literalism has externalised God and internalised shame.</p>
<p>What was meant to liberate has often imprisoned. What was meant to show man as the image of God has been used to make man feel unworthy of God. The tragedy is not in the text, but in the interpretation.</p>
<p>The Bible, rightly understood, becomes a handbook for inner transformation — not condemnation. And imagination, far from being sinful, is revealed as the divine spark itself.</p>
