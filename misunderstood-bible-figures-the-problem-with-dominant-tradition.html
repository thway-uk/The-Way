    <h1>Misunderstood Bible Figures: The Problem with Dominant Tradition</h1>
    <p>For centuries, certain biblical figures have been cast in the shadows—seen as fallen, sinful, or morally weak. Yet Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a record of external sins or virtues. It is a <strong>psychological allegory</strong>, a symbolic journey of the awareness, where each character represents a <strong>state of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a></strong> within us. When we understand this, those once-condemned figures reveal spiritual concepts, not cautionary tales.</p>
<p>Let’s unravel some of the most common myths through the symbolic vision Neville offers.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Mary Magdalene: Not a Prostitute, but the Cleansed Imagination</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> That she was a former prostitute.<br />
<strong>The truth (Neville’s view):</strong> <a href="/2025/04/mary-magdalene-heart-of-divine.html">Mary represents the <strong>imagination purified</strong></a>—a <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> no longer tormented by unlovely states (the "<a href="/2025/04/the-seven-devils-cast-out-of-mary.html">seven demons</a>"). She becomes the <strong>first to witness the resurrection</strong>, not because of morality, but because the awakened imagination is the only part of us capable of perceiving fulfilled desire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“She turns from the world of facts to the world of feeling. Only she can say, ‘I have seen the Lord.’”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary follows the <a href="https://www.thway.uk/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM” </a>in faith, showing imagination aligned with its inner assumption—not the outer appearance.

<h2><strong>Eve: The Awakening of Desire, Not the Origin of Sin</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Eve caused the downfall of mankind.<br />
<strong>The truth:</strong> <a href="/2025/04/eve-was-never-problem-neville-goddards.html">Eve</a>, the first <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> symbolises <strong>the womb of desire</strong>—the moment man begins to imagine. The serpent’s suggestion ("You shall be as gods") is not evil, but the first whisper of <strong>spiritual awakening</strong>.</p>
<p>Eating the fruit is the choice to <strong>imagine beyond the current state</strong>. The so-called “fall” is merely <strong>descent into the world of experience</strong>—where imagined states now take time, effort, and faith to manifest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eve does not fall—she conceives.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2><strong>David and Bathsheba: A Crisis of Focus, Not a Crime</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> David’s act was a scandal of lust and murder.<br />
<strong>The truth:</strong> David is the <strong>newly anointed state of consciousness</strong>; Bathsheba, a <strong>deep inner desire</strong>. <a href="/search?q=Bathsheba+David">Uriah</a>, whose name means “light of God,” is the loyalty to the <strong>former state</strong>—outgrown but still burning. The story is a <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">demonstration of sin</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To manifest the new, we must ‘put to death’ the old self—even when it feels righteous.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon—<strong>peace and wisdom</strong>—proving that even disruptive inner conflict gives birth to higher understanding.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Judas Iscariot: The Death of the Old Identity</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Judas is the ultimate traitor.<br />
<strong>The truth:</strong> <a href="/2025/04/judah-and-judas-two-paths-to-same.html">Judas is the <strong>necessary agent of transformation</strong></a>. He represents the part of us that <strong>releases the old self</strong> so the new identity (resurrection) can emerge.</p>
<p>The “thirty pieces of silver” are the value we place on outer identity. When Judas betrays Jesus (our assumed self), the path to <strong>transcendence</strong> begins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Judas is not evil—he plays the part we each must play when we let go of who we’ve been.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Samson: The Power of Imagination Undirected</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Samson fell due to lust and weakness.<br />
<strong>The truth:</strong> Samson is raw, <strong>unfocused imagination</strong>—mighty, but without inner purpose. Delilah is the outer world of senses, seducing attention away from inner vision.</p>
<p>When Samson reveals his secret (his consecration), he hands his power to the outer. Yet even blind, he remembers the Source and pulls down the temple—<strong>collapsing limiting beliefs</strong> with one final inward act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>True strength lies not in seeing the world, but in seeing it rightly.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The 'Sinful Woman': A Picture of Devotion, Not Shame</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The myth:</strong> A nameless <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">woman</a> weeping at Jesus’ feet must be shameful.<br />
<strong>The truth:</strong> She is the <strong>soul pouring out feeling upon a new assumption</strong>. Her tears, kisses, and ointment symbolise <strong>emotion, love, and attention</strong>—key ingredients in the creative process.</p>
<p>The others see facts. She sees fulfilment. And so Jesus (the “I AM”) declares: <em>“Your faith has saved you.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>There Are No Sinners—Only States</strong></h2>
<p>Neville taught that there is <strong>no condemnation</strong> in the Bible—only <strong>symbolism</strong>. Each so-called failure is a reflection of the <strong>inner struggle to evolve</strong>. There are no villains, only forgotten aspects of self. No punishments, only processes.</p>
<p>Whether it is Eve reaching for potential, Mary discovering imagination, or Judas letting go—<strong>every act is a movement in consciousness</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Man is not a sinner in need of saving—he is a dreamer in need of remembering.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Let the Misunderstood Speak</strong></h3>
<p>When read through the eyes of Neville’s insight, the Bible becomes a guidebook of <strong>inner transformation</strong>. Every misunderstood figure is a mirror—showing us that what the world calls shame, the soul may call <strong>awakening</strong>.</p>
