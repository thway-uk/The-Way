<h1>What the Most Googled Bible Questions Reveal—and What Neville Goddard Would Say</h1>
<p>It’s telling that some of the most commonly Googled Bible questions aren’t about historical accuracy or doctrine, but about deeply personal and emotional issues. People want to know what the Bible says about sexuality, tattoos, the afterlife, and more—not just to understand Scripture, but to find clarity about themselves.</p>
<p>Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we discover that these are not external rules, but symbolic stories showing the workings of human consciousness and imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about homosexuality?”</strong></h2>
<p>In Neville's framework, the Bible is not a rulebook but a revelation of spiritual truth encoded in symbol and parable. It does not judge literal behaviour but illustrates inner dynamics.</p>
<p>The term <em>man</em> often symbolises consciousness, and <em>union</em> or <em>relations</em> symbolise states joining or merging. Seen symbolically, discussions around sexuality point to how different aspects of self (masculine/feminine = conscious/subconscious) are aligned or misaligned.</p>
<p>True “sin” for Neville is not moral violation, but <strong>missing the mark</strong>—failing to imagine lovingly, not conforming to societal expectations.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about tattoos?”</strong></h2>
<p>Tattoos in biblical texts often represent identity or allegiance. Neville would interpret this spiritually: what markings—what assumptions—have you allowed onto your consciousness?</p>
<p>What beliefs have been etched into your mind, and therefore into your world?</p>
<p>The real “tattoos” are the inner convictions you wear invisibly—your repeated assumptions, which become your fate.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Can a Christian lose salvation?”</strong></h2>
<p>Salvation, for Neville, is the awakening to your creative power—the realisation that <em>I AM</em> is God. You can forget this truth (descend into a lower state), but you cannot lose what is eternally within you.</p>
<p>Salvation is not a contract; it is a <strong>state of remembrance</strong>. You may fall asleep to your power, but you can always reawaken.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about suicide?”</strong></h2>
<p>Neville frames all Bible stories as psychological parables. Suicide, in its symbolic sense, is not just the end of physical life, but the <strong>collapse of self-awareness</strong>, the wounding of hope, the silence of imagination.</p>
<p>To “kill” yourself can represent surrendering to despair. Yet Scripture also shows that resurrection is always offered. Lazarus, who dies, is called forth: <em>“Come out!”</em></p>
<p>That voice is imagination—rising again from the tomb of limitation.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Do pets go to heaven?”</strong></h2>
<p>Heaven, in Neville’s teaching, is not a place but a <strong>state of consciousness</strong>. All things exist in imagination.</p>
<p>The love we share with animals is a part of us—eternally held in the imagination of God, which is our imagination. In that sense, nothing is lost.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What happens after death?”</strong></h2>
<p>Death is a transition—a shift in awareness. Just as we move from dream to waking, we move from one state to another. The <em>I AM</em> never dies; it changes form, context, and experience.</p>
<p>Consciousness continues, clothed in the beliefs it held at the time of transition.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about drinking alcohol?”</strong></h2>
<p>Alcohol in Scripture symbolises <strong>influence</strong> or <strong>spiritual saturation</strong>. To be drunk may mean to be overtaken—either by divine fervour or destructive suggestion.</p>
<p>Neville would urge: watch what thoughts you imbibe. The only intoxication worth pursuing is one of divine imagination and loving conviction.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about divorce and remarriage?”</strong></h2>
<p>In symbolic terms, “marriage” means <strong>the union of states</strong>. To divorce is to detach from a former identity; to remarry is to assume a new one.</p>
<p>Neville encourages us to “divorce” from states of fear, limitation, and doubt, and marry the feeling of the wish fulfilled. The Bible is a chronicle of inner transition—from bondage to freedom, from shadow to selfhood.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about sex before marriage?”</strong></h2>
<p>Sex is symbolic of <strong>creative union</strong> in Neville’s teaching—where the conscious (masculine) and subconscious (feminine) come together to conceive reality.</p>
<p>“Marriage” is not legality but the full assumption of a state. The real question is: are your desires aligned with your inner belief? True purity lies not in behaviour, but in intention.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“What does the Bible say about dinosaurs?”</strong></h2>
<p>This question belongs more to history than spiritual revelation. From Neville’s view, the Bible is not concerned with literal history but with <strong>symbolic unfolding</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether dinosaurs existed (and evidence suggests they did) does not negate the inner truths of Scripture: that <em>man is imagination</em>, and the world is its projection.</p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>The Bigger Questions</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>“Is there a God?”</strong></h2>
<p>Yes—and Neville says: <em>God is your own wonderful human imagination</em>. The creator is not separate from you. Every time you say “I am,” you are naming the creative power of the universe.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Why does God allow pain and suffering?”</strong></h2>
<p>Because God is not a puppeteer. God is you—asleep, unaware of your own creative capacity. Suffering arises from unconscious creation, from allowing fear, doubt, and old assumptions to rule.</p>
<p>But you can revise. You can imagine anew.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Is the Bible reliable?”</strong></h2>
<p>The Bible is not historically accurate—it is <strong>spiritually exact</strong>. Every character and event mirrors a psychological journey.</p>
<p>It is a map of consciousness: a symbolic autobiography of the soul awakening to its own divinity.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Is Jesus God?”</strong></h2>
<p>Yes—and so are you, in potential. Jesus symbolises the <strong>awakened imagination</strong>—the realisation that “I and my Father are one.”</p>
<p>To live as Jesus is to assume your ideal, forgive all, and trust in the unseen reality until it becomes flesh.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Can I know God personally?”</strong></h2>
<p>You already do. Every time you imagine, love, grieve, or hope, you engage with God.</p>
<p>God is not separate. God is <em>I AM</em>. And that is the name you whisper every moment of your life.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>In Closing</strong></h3>
