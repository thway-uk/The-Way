    <h1>Proverbs 23: Neville Style</h1>
    <p>When reading the Bible through the perspective of mysticism and metaphysical interpretation, entire chapters can unfold in surprising and life-changing ways. One powerful example is <strong>Proverbs 23</strong> — a chapter often taken at face value, but when viewed through the teachings of <strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, it reveals profound truths about <strong>consciousness, imagination, and the creative power within</strong>.</p><p>Let’s explore how Proverbs 23 speaks not just to ancient wisdom, but to the inner world of thought and assumption that shapes our reality.</p><hr /><h3><strong>“As he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Proverbs 23:7)</strong></h3><p>This line is pure Neville. Your <strong>inner beliefs</strong>, especially those held deeply in your heart (subconscious), <strong>determine the kind of life you experience</strong>. Neville taught that imagining from the end — assuming your wish is already fulfilled — is the secret to shaping your world. Your reality is nothing more than an outpicturing of your self-concept.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Verses 1–3: Be Mindful of What You “Eat”</strong></h3><p>“When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee…”</p><p>The “ruler” here can represent dominant <strong>ideas, media, societal norms</strong>, or even your own habitual thoughts. To “eat” with the ruler means to <strong>mentally consume</strong> — to accept — these influences. Neville warned us to be cautious of what we <strong>impress upon the subconscious</strong>, as it doesn’t judge but simply accepts and reproduces. Guard your mental diet.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Verse 4: “Labour not to be rich”</strong></h3><p>Neville would say: <strong>Do not toil outwardly in hopes of creating wealth</strong>. Instead, <strong>imagine yourself already in possession of the wealth</strong>, feel the reality of it internally, and let your outer world rearrange itself to reflect your assumption.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Verse 22: “Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.”</strong></h3><p>Neville often saw <strong>“father”</strong> and <strong>“mother”</strong> as symbols of the creative mind:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>father</strong> is your <strong>imagination</strong>, the source from which all things are begotten.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>mother</strong> is your <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, which receives the impressions of the imagination and brings them into form.</p></li></ul><p>To "hearken unto thy father" is to return to the awareness that <strong>your imagination is the true source of all creation</strong>. And to "not despise your mother when she is old" is to <strong>honor the subconscious</strong>, even when the process seems slow or stale. Continue trusting the <strong>inner mechanism</strong> that brings your desires into being.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Verse 18: “Thine expectation shall not be cut off.”</strong></h3><p>This is the spiritual reward for persistence. Neville would say: <strong>Remain faithful to your imagined end</strong>. If you fully assume and dwell in the feeling of your wish fulfilled, its manifestation is guaranteed. Expectation rooted in conviction is a spiritual law — not a hope, but a certainty.</p><hr /><p><strong>Final Thought:</strong></p><p>Proverbs 23, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s spiritual framework, becomes a <strong>roadmap for mental mastery and conscious creation</strong>. The Bible is not just a moral code or historical record — it’s a metaphysical manual. Every verse holds hidden truths about how your <strong>inner world creates your outer life</strong>.</p><p>Live from within. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. And let the wisdom of ancient scripture awaken in a whole new light.</p><hr /><p><br /></p>
