<h1>Daniel's Visions of a Goat and Ram</h1>
<p>Daniel 8 is a story of your <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">mind</a>. Through Neville Goddard’s teachings, we see this chapter as the inner conflict between your current beliefs and a <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">new desire</a> you want to embody. It shows how imagination can overthrow old assumptions and bring a new reality to life.</p><p><strong>Daniel’s Vision Begins: The Witness Awakens</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:1–2</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>"Daniel" symbolises the awakened imagination — the part of you that becomes conscious of your inner world and its power to shape outer life. "Shushan" points to a refined, fragrant state of mind, while the "river Ulai" represents the spiritual current flowing within. The vision occurring in the third year signifies the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">journeying of the mind</a>, preparing you to see a new, deeper truth. His visions are <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">imaginative assumptions in action</a>.</p><p><strong>The Ram with Two Horns: Present Reality and Dual Belief</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:3–4</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>The ram represents your current assumed reality, strengthened by two "horns" — beliefs you have accepted. One horn rising higher and later suggests a newer dominant belief overtaking the old (for example, fear becoming stronger than faith). The directions show this state extending into all areas of experience, commanding your world through your self-concept.</p><p><strong>The Goat Appears: Imagination Ignites Desire</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:5</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>The goat symbolises a new assumption arising in imagination, coming "from the west" — the subconscious realm. It "touched not the ground" because it is not yet manifest; it lives only in the imaginal world. The notable horn between its eyes represents single, focused intent — a disciplined, unwavering inner vision. As Neville said, “Imagination is seeing with the eye of God.”</p><p><strong>The Clash: New Assumption Confronts Old Reality</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"And he came to the ram that had two horns... and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him..."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:6–7</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>This scene represents the inner battle between your new desire (the goat) and your established beliefs (the ram). The goat shatters the horns — meaning the old duality is destroyed. The ram is cast down; your former reality is now overpowered by your new state. As Neville taught, you persist in the assumption until the old state collapses.</p><p><strong>The Great Horn Breaks: Letting Go of the Imaginal Act</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:8</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>When the imaginal act is at its peak, it must be released. The breaking horn symbolises surrender — "feel it real and then let it go." The four new horns signify the desire spreading into all areas of consciousness, moving from imagining into expectancy. The seed is now planted.</p><p><strong>The Little Horn: Doubt Creeps In</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great... and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:9–10</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>After planting a new state, doubt often arises — the "little horn" that questions: "What if it doesn't happen?" This small thought grows, challenging and casting down your higher thoughts and inner affirmations. The stars falling symbolise losing your imaginal conviction, bringing your faith back down to sense-based reality.</p><p><strong>Daily Sacrifice Removed: Discontinuing Inner Work</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down... and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:11–12</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>This represents abandoning your daily imaginal practice. The "daily sacrifice" is your regular inner work: visualisation, assumption, and disciplined focus. The sanctuary (imagination) is cast down when you allow external evidence to dominate. When you give up the unseen, you cast truth to the ground and strengthen old limitations.</p><p><strong>"How Long?" — The Trap of Time</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said... ‘How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation...?’ And he said unto me, ‘Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.’"<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:13–14</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>"How long?" is the voice of impatience. Neville warned that watching the clock destroys faith. The "2,300 days" is symbolic: it means as long as necessary for the new assumption to feel natural and effortless. Only then is the sanctuary (your inner creative centre) cleansed and restored.</p><p><strong>Gabriel Explains: Intuition Offers Clarity</strong><br />
(<em>Daniel 8:15–26</em>)</p><p>Gabriel represents intuition or inner wisdom. He reveals that the ram and goat are not literal kings but symbolic states of mind. The "king of fierce countenance" is your doubting reason — the sophisticated voice against your imagination. Yet even this opposition eventually fades as your inner division dissolves. The core message: these are inner dynamics, not outer enemies.</p><p><strong>Daniel is Exhausted: The Human Reaction to Spiritual Vision</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."<br />
(<em>Daniel 8:27</em>)</p>
</blockquote><p>Daniel’s fainting is symbolic of total surrender — the overwhelm that comes from confronting the conflict between inner vision and outer fact. Neville described this as a necessary "death" of the old self. Despite exhaustion, Daniel rises to continue the king’s business — the inner work of sustaining assumption, even when others do not understand.</p><hr /><p><strong>Summary: Daniel 8 as the Drama of Assumption</strong></p><ul>
