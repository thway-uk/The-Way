These parallels reveal a deeper symbolic thread, where each shepherd, each lost sheep, and each act of gathering points inward to the soul’s journey and the transformation of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>.<p></p><p>
<em>According to Neville Goddard’s Psychological Interpretation</em></p>
<p>Across Scripture, the imagery of shepherds and sheep symbolises the relationship between <strong>awareness</strong> (the shepherd) and its <strong>assumptions</strong> (the flock). In <strong>Ezekiel 34</strong>, God condemns the false shepherds of Israel and promises a true Shepherd — a prophecy echoed by <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> in the New Testament when He instructs, “Feed my sheep.” Neville Goddard reads these passages not as literal history but as symbolic of how consciousness guides imagination toward fulfilment.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ezekiel 34 — False Shepherds and the Promise of the True</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Woe be to the shepherds that feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?... I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David.”<br />
— <em>Ezekiel 34:2, 23</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>False shepherds</strong> symbolise undisciplined beliefs and reactive thoughts that scatter and fail to nurture your inner world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The flock</strong> represents your mental assumptions, wandering and hungry for conscious direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My servant <a href="/search/label/David%20Series">David</a></strong> denotes the awakened imagination—the true <a href="/search/label/Shepherd%20and%20Lamb%20Series">Shepherd</a> who feeds the flock with the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Scripture the shepherd is the power of consciousness which watches over the lambs of imagination.” — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Jesus’ Commission — Feed My Sheep</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Feed my sheep.”<br />
— <em>John 21:17 </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Post-resurrection, Jesus commands His disciple: to nourish the flock he entrusted. Neville interprets this as your <strong>I AM awareness</strong> guiding your own psyche to maintain states of fulfilment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed</strong> — to assume and dwell in the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sheep</strong> — the individual thoughts and desires awaiting direction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“To feed your <a href="/search/label/Shepherd%20and%20Lamb%20Series">sheep</a> is to sustain the life of your desired state until it hardens into fact.” — <em>Neville Goddard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>New Testament Echoes of the Shepherd</h2>
<p>Neville highlights further passages where Jesus employs shepherd imagery — each echoing Ezekiel’s themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“I AM the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”</strong><br />
<em>John 10:11 </em><br />
Jesus embodies the destined true Shepherd, sacrificing old identities to rescue and restore the flock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring.”</strong><br />
<em>John 10:16 </em><br />
The promise of expanding awareness beyond current beliefs, mirroring Ezekiel’s gathering of scattered sheep into one fold (Ezekiel 34:16).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“I AM the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved.”</strong><br />
<em>John 10:7-9 </em><br />
Jesus as the gateway to restored relationship — just as Ezekiel 34 condemns closed gates that trap and scatter sheep (Ezekiel 34:21).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“He brings back the fold to the strong and feeds them in the high pasture.”</strong><br />
<em>Ezekiel 34:14 </em><br />
Paralleled in <strong>Matthew 18:12-13</strong> (BBE) where Jesus explains the shepherd leaves ninety-nine to seek the one lost sheep — illustrating the active rescue of scattered assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“When He saw the multitudes, He had compassion on them, because they were distressed and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.”</strong><br />
<em>Matthew 9:36 </em><br />
Echoing Ezekiel’s opening indictment of lost and hungry sheep (Ezekiel 34:6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Feed my lambs… feed my sheep… feed my sheep.”</strong><br />
<em>John 21:15-17 </em><br />
This threefold charge parallels Ezekiel’s emphasis on shepherds feeding the flock (Ezekiel 34:2), underscoring the necessity of guardianship and sustenance in the inner world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Practising the Shepherd’s Role</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Sheep</strong><br />
Observe your dominant thoughts. Which are scattered or distressed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume the Shepherd’s Posture</strong><br />
Cultivate “I AM” feelings of fulfilment: “I AM safe,” “I AM abundant.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed the Flock</strong><br />
Envelop each thought in the feeling of the wish fulfilled until it aligns with your desired state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resist False Shepherds</strong><br />
Notice doubts and fears. Refuse them attention; they scatter the flock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain the Fold</strong><br />
Return daily to disciplined imagination, feeding your flock until it becomes your reality.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion — The Inner Shepherding</h2>
<p>From Ezekiel’s prophecy to Jesus’ commission, the shepherd motif maps consciousness tending imagination. Neville Goddard teaches that your “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>” awareness is the true Shepherd, and your assumptions are the sheep. By feeding your flock with deliberate, fulfilled assumption, you shepherd your inner world into a manifesting reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are the Shepherd. Your imagination is the flock. Assume your desired state and feed it until it becomes your world.” — <em>Inspired by Neville Goddard</em></p></blockquote><p>Note: If the Bible was just literal history, it would be unusual to find such deliberate and repeated parallels between the words of Ezekiel and the teachings of Jesus. These echoes suggest a psychological symbolism at work — not just events, but states of consciousness and inner guidance reflected through narrative. </p>
