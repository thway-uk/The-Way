<h1>The Simon and Peter: A Deeper Look</h1>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, names in the Bible are not just identifiers but symbols of profound inner states and the creative powers of consciousness. When we look at the Hebrew names <strong>Samuel</strong> ("God has heard") and <strong>Simon</strong> ("he who hears"), we uncover rich meanings that align perfectly with Neville’s principles of manifestation and the power of imagination. Let’s explore how these names relate to Neville's framework of creating reality from within, and also bring <strong>Peter</strong> into the picture.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Samuel: "God Has Heard"</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s teachings, <strong>Samuel</strong>, meaning “God has heard,” represents a key moment in the manifestation process: the point at which the <strong>desire or assumption is received by the subconscious mind</strong>. The "God" in this context is the <strong>I AM</strong> — the imagination, or creative force, within each of us. So, when we say “God has heard,” we are speaking about the assumption or desire being <strong>acknowledged by the subconscious mind</strong>.</p><p>This moment corresponds to when the <strong>inner self</strong> responds to the desire and starts the process of bringing it into reality. In Neville’s framework, it reflects <strong>faith</strong> — the belief that the inner self has heard the desire and is now working to manifest it.</p><p>Just as in <strong>Samuel’s story</strong> where he hears God’s voice calling him, it represents the <strong>realisation</strong> that the desire has been heard within the imagination and that the manifestation process is underway. Samuel’s story is a metaphor for <strong>tuning into the inner voice</strong> and recognising that your assumption has been <strong>received</strong> by your subconscious mind, ready for fulfilment.</p><p>Here’s the moment from <strong>1 Samuel 3:10</strong> (BBE) where Samuel hears God’s voice for the first time:</p><p><em>“And the Lord came and took his place, and said as he did before, ‘Samuel, Samuel.’ And Samuel said, ‘Speak, for your servant is hearing.’”</em></p><p>This verse marks the moment of <strong>receptivity</strong>, when Samuel hears the call, just as we must listen and receive the inner call of our desires in order to manifest them.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Simon: "He Who Hears"</strong></h3><p>The name <strong>Simon</strong>, meaning “he who hears,” has a vital role in Neville’s teachings. Hearing, in Neville’s interpretation, is the first step in the manifestation process — the moment when you <strong>become aware of the new assumption or desire</strong> you wish to create. However, hearing alone is not enough. The next crucial step is to <strong>respond</strong> to that inner voice, which Simon does by following Jesus.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, hearing represents the moment when you first <strong>recognise</strong> the inner call to create or manifest a new reality. Simon’s name indicates <strong>receptivity</strong> to the call of imagination, but he still has to take action — to fully <strong>align with the assumption</strong> and bring it into being.</p><p>Simon’s journey is about <strong>awakening</strong> to the creative power within and realising that you can manifest what you desire through imagination. The “hearing” is the initial awareness, but to manifest, you must <strong>respond</strong> to what you hear, embodying the assumption that your desire is already realised.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Peter: "The Rock"</strong></h3><p>Later in the New Testament, Simon’s name is changed to <strong>Peter</strong>, which means “rock.” This shift is significant in Neville Goddard’s interpretation. The name <strong>Peter</strong> symbolises <strong>the foundation of creation</strong> — the firm belief in the assumption that you are trying to manifest. The rock represents <strong>stability</strong>, <strong>certainty</strong>, and the <strong>unshakeable belief</strong> that the assumption you are imagining is already true.</p><p>In Neville’s framework, <strong>Peter</strong> is the <strong>embodiment of the fully established belief</strong> in your desired reality. It’s the moment when you no longer waver in doubt but instead stand firm, knowing that the creative power of your imagination has already made your assumption a reality. Just as Peter’s name signifies a solid foundation, <strong>a strong and unwavering belief</strong> in your assumption is the key to manifesting it.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Journey from Simon to Samuel to Peter: A Process of Awakening</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s framework, all three names — <strong>Samuel</strong>, <strong>Simon</strong>, and <strong>Peter</strong> — represent important stages of spiritual awakening and manifestation:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Samuel (“God has heard”)</strong>: This represents the moment when the <strong>desire is acknowledged</strong> by the subconscious. The inner self has heard the assumption and is ready to act. It’s the confirmation that the subconscious is now aligned with the assumption, making manifestation possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simon (“he who hears”)</strong>: Simon represents the <strong>receptivity</strong> or <strong>awareness</strong> of the desire. This is the first step — hearing the inner voice and becoming aware of what you want to create. But it’s not enough to just hear; Simon must also take action to manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peter (“the rock”)</strong>: Peter signifies the <strong>firm belief</strong> and <strong>established foundation</strong> in your desire. It is the moment when your assumption is <strong>solidified in the imagination</strong>, and no external doubt can shake your inner knowing that your desire has already been realised.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Together, these names show the journey from <strong>receptivity</strong> to <strong>realisation</strong>, and finally to the <strong>unwavering certainty</strong> needed to manifest your desires. They reflect Neville’s idea that the power of creation lies within us, and the process begins with <strong>awareness</strong>, progresses through <strong>faith</strong>, and culminates in <strong>unshakable belief</strong>.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Power of "I AM"</strong></h3><p>The transformation from <strong>Simon</strong> to <strong>Samuel</strong> to <strong>Peter</strong> can be seen as a metaphor for the manifestation process. <strong>Samuel</strong> reflects the moment when your assumption is received and accepted by the subconscious (God/I AM). <strong>Simon</strong> represents the first step — the awareness of the assumption that sparks the manifestation process. And <strong>Peter</strong> embodies the firm, unshakeable belief that the assumption is already realised in the imagination, paving the way for its manifestation.</p><p>Neville Goddard teaches that once we recognise our own <strong>I AM</strong> — our creative power and imagination — we begin to create our reality from the inside out. The names <strong>Samuel</strong>, <strong>Simon</strong>, and <strong>Peter</strong>, when viewed through Neville’s lens, reveal the deep process of hearing, accepting, realising, and solidifying the desires that shape our lives. By understanding the symbolism of these names, we can see how the inner journey of transformation mirrors the creative process of manifestation.</p>
