    <h1>Laban: The First Shall Be Last</h1>
    <blockquote><p><em>“So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.”</em><br />
— Matthew 20:16</p>
</blockquote><p>At first glance, this statement from Jesus sounds like poetic justice—divine favour for the underdog. But look deeper, and you’ll see something more exact, more mysterious: <strong>a spiritual law governing manifestation.</strong></p><p>It’s not about injustice being righted.<br />
It’s about <strong><a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">God’s creative order</a> stated in Genesis 2:24, </strong>where the visible yields to the invisible, the elder serves the younger, and the end is assumed before the beginning.</p><p>This is what Neville Goddard called <strong>“living in the end.”</strong><br />
And the Bible is full of it.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Divine Reversal Is Divine Order</strong></h3><p>Throughout Scripture, one pattern repeats itself:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Esau and Jacob</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leah and Rachel</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul and David </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adam and Jesus</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>In every pair, the second rises above the first—not to punish the first, but to fulfil the promise.</p><p>This is not mere reversal—it is <strong>evolution.</strong><br />
It shows that manifestation is not chronological.<br />
It’s <strong>imaginal.</strong></p><p>The world sees what comes first.<br />
God honours what comes from within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Laban: The Old Pattern Trying to Force the Old Order</strong></h3><p>Laban, the father of Leah and Rachel, symbolises the <strong>old pattern</strong>—the stubborn external order that attempts to control and impose itself on the process of manifestation.</p><p></p><blockquote>And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older. - Gen 29:26- 26 </blockquote><p></p><p>When Jacob desires to marry Rachel, Laban deceives him by giving him Leah, the older daughter, first.</p><p>This is a powerful spiritual metaphor:<br />
<strong>Laban is the resistance of the old order, trying to force the first-born pattern before the new can emerge.</strong></p><p>Jacob realises this imposition is a block to his promise.</p><p>So, <strong>he decides to move away</strong>—to break free from Laban’s old pattern and control.</p><p>Only after serving seven more years is Jacob finally able to receive Rachel, the beloved younger daughter, symbolising the new imaginal promise.</p><p>This shows the spiritual law that the old order must be recognised and decisively left behind before the new can be fully embraced.</p><p>Jacob’s departure is an act of breaking free from the imposed old way and choosing the new pattern—living in the end rather than being bound by appearances.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jacob and Esau: The Inner Man Must Supplant the Outer</strong></h3><p>Esau is born first—rugged, physical, earthy.<br />
Jacob follows—quiet, inner, imaginal.</p><p>But Jacob becomes Israel.<br />
Because Jacob is the <strong>inner man</strong>, the one who dreams, wrestles, persists.<br />
Esau is the five senses. Jacob is the sixth.</p><p>This is not preference.<br />
It’s process.</p><p>Your imagination must overtake your senses if you are to manifest your promise.<br />
<strong>The outer man must serve the inner.</strong><br />
The first (what is seen) must yield to the last (what is imagined).</p><p>This is living in the end.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Manasseh and Ephraim: Fruitfulness Comes Before Forgetting</strong></h3><p>When Joseph brings his sons to Israel for a blessing, he places Manasseh—the firstborn—at Israel’s right hand.</p><p>But Israel crosses his hands.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I know, my son, I know… but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.”</em> (Genesis 48:19)</p>
</blockquote><p>Manasseh means <em>“forgetting.”</em><br />
Ephraim means <em>“fruitfulness.”</em></p><p>We assume we must first forget the past, clear all blocks, and release the trauma—<em>then</em> we will bear fruit.</p><p>But Israel says no.</p><p><strong>Fruitfulness comes first.</strong><br />
The end must be lived now.</p><p>Neville put it plainly:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Dare to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The forgetting follows the fruit.<br />
The release follows the assumption.<br />
The healing follows the wholeness you dare to live now.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Benjamin and Joseph: The Beloved of the End</strong></h3><p>Joseph is a dreamer. A forerunner. The imaginative man thrown into a pit but destined to rule.</p><p>But his beloved is <strong>Benjamin</strong>, the youngest.<br />
The one born last.<br />
The one who nearly kills Rachel, Joseph’s spiritual counterpart.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because <strong>Benjamin represents the new birth</strong>—the <em>last</em> thing to appear, but the <em>first</em> in affection and meaning.<br />
He symbolises the thing you treasure most:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The final result,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desired state,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The completion.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>He is the child of sorrow who becomes the child of the right hand.</p><p><strong>What appears last is what your soul loves most.</strong><br />
This is the blessing of living in the end:<br />
You treasure the thing not yet seen, because you already hold it within.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jesus: The Firstborn From the End</strong></h3><p>Jesus is the ultimate “last” to appear—born in obscurity, rejected, misunderstood.<br />
And yet, Scripture calls Him:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“the firstborn of every creature.”</em><br />
<em>“the last Adam… a life-giving spirit.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He shows us the divine order in full:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The world says, “prove it, and then we’ll believe.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus says, “believe, and it will be.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>His whole ministry models <strong>living in the end</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Feeding the five thousand with thanksgiving <em>before</em> the bread multiplies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calling Lazarus out <em>before</em> the stone is moved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying <em>“It is finished”</em> before the world saw what He finished.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>Neville’s Law: Assume the End, Reverse the Order</strong></h3><p>Neville didn’t invent this.<br />
He interpreted it. He <em>remembered</em> it.<br />
He showed us that what the Bible portrays symbolically, we are meant to <strong>live literally—within.</strong></p><p>To live in the end is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Bless Ephraim before Manasseh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believe Jacob over Esau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See Benjamin as the beloved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And walk as Christ before the world ever knows your name.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>“To be transformed, the whole basis of your thought must change. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and continue feeling that it is fulfilled until that which you feel objectifies itself.”</em><br />
