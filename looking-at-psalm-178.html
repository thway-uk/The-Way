    <h1>Looking at Psalm 17:8</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard would interpret Psalm 17:8, "Keep me as the light of your eyes, covering me with the shade of your wings," as a metaphor for the relationship between consciousness and divine protection or guidance. He would likely view the "light of your eyes" as representing the inner vision or awareness—the "I AM" presence—through which we perceive the world and our desires.</p>
<p>The "shade of your wings" would symbolize the protective, comforting embrace of the divine or the higher self, which surrounds us and keeps us safe when we align ourselves with the right state of consciousness. Neville often emphasized that by imagining ourselves as being in a desired state, we are aligning with the divine and attracting the protection, blessings, or experiences that we imagine and believe to be true.</p>
<p>Thus, Goddard would suggest that this verse points to the importance of staying rooted in the consciousness of being loved, safe, and guided by the divine (the "light" of awareness) and trusting in the protective power of that consciousness to manifest in our lives. Through this inner alignment, we would experience the fulfillment of our desires and protection in all aspects of life.</p>
