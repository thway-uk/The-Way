    <h1>Elijah: Jezebel</h1>
    <p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, Scripture is not a historical record but a psychological drama unfolding within the <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">human mind</a>. Every character symbolises a state of consciousness, and every event reflects the assumptions that shape your reality.</p><p>In this inner drama, the <em><a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a></em> represents conscious awareness—the “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>” of <strong>Exodus 3:14</strong>, from which all creation flows. The <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html"><em>woman</em>, called forth from man</a>, symbolises the outer world or any manifested condition. She is not separate from you, but a projection of what you have internalised as true.</p><p>When Adam says, <em>“This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,”</em> he recognises that the world he sees is born of his own consciousness. Every condition you <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">experience springs from your assumptions</a>—and it is in this context that the figures of Jezebel, Ahab, and Elijah take on symbolic power.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Jezebel: The Outpicturing of Misused Assumptions</strong></h2><p>Jezebel is not a literal woman but the outpicturing of distorted or neglected assumptions. She is similar in nature to <a href="/2025/05/miriam-mary-as-rebellious-woman.html">Miriam</a>. In Neville’s framework, the subconscious never sleeps—it faithfully produces outcomes based on what has been impressed upon it. Jezebel symbolises the assumptions formed in reaction to fear, lack, resentment, or inferiority—those patterns that operate beneath awareness and go unchallenged.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>"And Ahab took for his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, and went after Baal and gave him worship."</strong><br />
<em>— 1 Kings 16:31, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ahab’s marriage to Jezebel symbolises conscious awareness (Ahab) yielding to a world shaped by reactive, external assumptions (Jezebel). When you surrender your inner authority to fear, doubt, or outer appearances, Jezebel rises as ruler. She reflects the world that takes form when imagination is misdirected or passively allowed to run amok.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Ahab: The Abdicated “I AM”</strong></h2><p>The name <strong>Ahab</strong>, meaning “father’s brother,” suggests nearness to power but not yet embodying it. He represents a version of <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM</a>” that has lost its awareness of being the operant power. Rather than asserting dominion over assumption, Ahab succumbs to appearances and allows the external world to dictate his inner state.</p><p>To serve <em>Baal</em> is, in Neville's language, to believe in any power outside yourself. It is to forget that you are the creator of your experience and to believe instead that people, situations, or systems have the power to determine your life. Ahab’s fall is your own when you accept outer facts as final and forget your role as the one who assumes.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Elijah: The Awakening of Consciousness</strong></h2><p>Elijah’s name means <em>“<a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">My God is Yah</a>”</em> or, symbolically, <em>“I AM.”</em> He represents the return of awakened consciousness—the fiery moment when you remember who you truly are.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“Then Elijah made his prayer to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven... And when the people saw it, they went down on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is God.”</strong><br />
<em>— 1 Kings 18:36–39, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The fire is not destruction—it is inner clarity. It burns away illusion and awakens the realisation that the power to change your world has always been within you. Elijah arises when you stop negotiating with false beliefs and instead call upon the truth of I AM. The fire reveals and purifies, not to punish, but to cleanse the mind of unworthy assumptions.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Meaning of Their Names</strong></h2><p>In Neville’s understanding, names are not arbitrary; they reveal the essence of the state each character represents.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jezebel</strong> (Hebrew: <em>Iyzevel</em>) is often interpreted as <em>“Where is the prince?”</em> or <em>“Unhusbanded.”</em> She symbolises assumptions disconnected from their true creative source—cut off from the authority of I AM. Her name poses a question: <em>Where is the one who governs consciousness?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ahab</strong> (“Father’s brother”) symbolises conscious awareness near to power, but not claiming it. He is the “I AM” when it is passive, reliant on outer conditions, and blind to its inheritance as creator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elijah</strong> (“My God is <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Yah</a>”) represents full recognition of the divine name <em>I AM</em>. He is the return to sovereignty—the awakening that nothing external determines your life unless you permit it.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h2><strong>Jezebel’s Last Stand: The Dissolution of False Assumptions</strong></h2><p>Jezebel does not quietly fade away. She attempts to maintain her illusion of power through appearance and manipulation.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel had news of it; and she put paint on her eyes and did up her hair, and she was looking out from the window.”</strong><br />
<em>— 2 Kings 9:30, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote><p>To paint the face is to disguise, to attempt to preserve false assumptions with charm, distraction, or pretence. Jezebel looks out from the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">window —your <em>perception</em></a>—trying to seduce assert dominance through illusion. But false beliefs cannot withstand the force of awakened awareness.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>“And he said, Throw her down. So they put her out of the window: and her blood went on the wall and on the horses: and she was crushed under their feet.”</strong><br />
<em>— 2 Kings 9:33, BBE</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jezebel is thrown down—false assumptions cast out. Her blood on the wall signifies the collapse of the old belief system, while the horses—symbols of forward motion—trample her, meaning consciousness can now progress freely, unburdened by illusion.</p><hr /><h2><strong>The Inner Drama of Assumption</strong></h2><p>Jezebel, Ahab, and Elijah are not historical figures—they are internal roles you play.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>When you <strong>abdicate authority</strong> to fear, resentment, or outer evidence, you become Ahab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you <strong>cling to harmful beliefs</strong>, sustain illusions, or manipulate appearances, Jezebel rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But when you remember the name <em>I AM</em>, when you reawaken to the truth of your inner power, Elijah rises, and the fire of awareness consumes what no longer serves you.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“Jezebel” is not someone else—she is your own reflection when you forget your power.<br />
“Ahab” is you when you hesitate, when you defer to appearances.<br />
“Elijah” is you when you remember.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>Every Condition is a Reflection</strong></h2><p>Every challenge in your life is an outpicturing of inner assumptions. When you realise that nothing external holds power over you, everything can change.</p><p>As Elijah called down fire to burn away the false prophets of Baal, so too can the fire of your awakened consciousness dissolve the illusions you have held. You are the one who assumes, and the world reflects it.</p>
