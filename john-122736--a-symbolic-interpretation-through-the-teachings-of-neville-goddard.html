<h1>John 12:27–36 — A Symbolic Interpretation Through the Teachings of Neville Goddard</h1>
<p>This passage reveals the deep inner process of transformation. It is the moment in which the awakened imagination—symbolised by Jesus—faces the necessary death of an old state of being in order to bring about a resurrection into something greater. Every verse contains spiritual symbolism, not of history, but of the inner journey we all must undertake to fully realise our creative power.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:27 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour? No, for this is why I came to this hour.”</em></p><p>This is the turning point of inner tension. The “soul” (imagination) feels the pressure of transformation. Jesus, as the divine within, refuses to avoid this moment. Instead of asking to be saved from discomfort, he recognises it as necessary. It is the death of the former concept of self—a necessary passage for conscious rebirth.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:28 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Father, give glory to your name. Then a voice came out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and will give it glory again.”</em></p><p>To glorify God’s name is to make the unconditioned ‘I AM’ visible through manifestation. The voice from heaven is the deep inner confirmation that the law of assumption has worked before and will continue to work—God (Imagination) is glorified every time a new state is successfully entered and lived from.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:29 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Then the people who were near, hearing the sound, said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.”</em></p><p>Some interpret inner revelation as mere noise—“thunder”—while others perceive it as a divine message. It mirrors the way most people ignore or misunderstand the subtle language of the subconscious and imagination, attributing it to external randomness.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:30 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you.”</em></p><p>This voice wasn’t to confirm the truth to the awakened awareness (Jesus), but to awaken the outer man. It’s a prompt for others to recognise the divine within themselves. Revelation always serves to awaken consciousness to its true creative nature.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:31 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out.”</em></p><p>The “ruler of this world” is the dominant self-concept—the assumptions that have governed one’s experience. To judge the world is to expose these assumptions and cast them out by consciously choosing a new identity. This is the essence of inner reformation.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:32 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me.”</em></p><p>To be lifted up means to raise your consciousness. When you dwell in the state of the wish fulfilled, you draw all things into alignment with it. Everything comes to match your inner world, just as Neville taught: “You become what you contemplate.”</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:33 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“(This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)”</em></p><p>The “death” is symbolic—it is the death of the old state of being. Jesus (the awareness of being) must be fixed upon a new idea. In Neville’s terms, this is crucifixion: the firm assumption of a new identity.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:34 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Then the people in answer said to him, We have knowledge from the law that the Christ is eternal: why do you say, The Son of man will be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?”</em></p><p>They misunderstand the message. “Christ” is seen as a static, eternal figure rather than an inner, evolving state. The “Son of man” is your own imaginative self—humanity’s capacity to assume and become. They question because they are still tied to outer forms and literal interpretations.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:35 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light is with you. Go on your way while you have the light, so that the dark may not overtake you: he who goes in the dark has no knowledge where he is going.”</em></p><p>The “light” is awareness of the truth—that ‘I AM’ is the creative power. Walk while you have it means live from the state of knowing before you fall again into habitual doubt. Darkness represents unconscious living—being ruled by inherited beliefs and outer appearances.</p><hr /><h3><strong>John 12:36 (BBE)</strong></h3><p><em>“In so far as you have the light, have faith in the light, so that you may become sons of the light. Jesus said these things, and then went away and was no longer seen by them.”</em></p><p>To believe in the light is to trust imagination as God. Becoming “sons of light” means being born from this awareness, not from flesh or outer identity. Jesus “hides” because the true work now becomes inward. Manifestation must follow conviction, and conviction is a quiet, internal process.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>This entire passage is not about an external sacrifice, but the internal decision to die to the old self and assume a new one—to enter the silence of conviction after receiving the light. This is the eternal message of transformation: Imagination, when lifted up, draws all things into manifestation. Live from that assumption, and the world will reflect it.</p><p><br /></p>
