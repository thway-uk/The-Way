    <h1>Be Still and Know That I Am God — Neville Goddard Explained</h1>
    <p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Be still, and know that I am God.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: large;">
— <em>Psalm 46:10</em></span></p></blockquote><p><em><span style="font-size: large;"></span></em></p>
<p>This verse is often used to encourage quiet or prayer. But through Neville Goddard’s teachings, it points to something more powerful: <strong>a reminder to silence the noise of doubt and recognise the creative power within</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Stillness Is Inner Control</h3>
<p>To "be still" doesn’t mean to do nothing. It means to <strong>step away from reaction</strong>. To stop looking to the outside world for answers. Neville taught that your imagination is God—the "I AM" within you.</p>
<p>When you quiet the fear, the overthinking, and the constant effort to change things from the outside, you create space to <strong>feel the truth of “I AM”</strong>—that your awareness itself is the source of all creation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Know It’s Already Done</h3>
<p>To <em>know that I am God</em> is to realise:<br />
<strong>Your inner state creates your outer world.</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to struggle to make it happen. You need to become still enough to believe it’s already done in imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h3>In Short:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Be still" = Stop reacting to the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Know" = Trust your imagination as the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I am God" = Your awareness creates your reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stillness isn’t passive—it’s powerful. It’s the quiet confidence that your assumption, held in imagination, is enough.</p>
