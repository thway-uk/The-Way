<h1>If Women Always Had Equal Rights, We'd All Be Manifesting by Now</h1>
<p>Can we talk about how <em>men</em> translated the Bible and somehow missed the memo that the entire thing is written in symbolic language?</p>
<p>They took metaphors meant for inner transformation and turned them into historical events and rules. It’s almost laughable—if it weren’t so devastating. Stories that were meant to awaken the divine imagination became tools for control. And why? Because the people holding the pen couldn’t grasp that the subconscious speaks in symbols. They read it with a literal mind—because they <em>hadn’t</em> cultivated the feminine side of their own being.</p>
<p>Let’s be real: symbolic thinking has always been aligned with femininity. It’s receptive, intuitive, inward. It’s the subconscious, the imagination, the womb of creation. But guess what was also denied for centuries? Women’s access to education. To the scriptures. To <em>interpretation</em>. What a coincidence.</p>
<p>If women had been allowed to read, to teach, to interpret—we might’ve seen the Bible for what it really is: a spiritual manual for manifestation, not a patriarchal playbook.</p>
<p>Instead, centuries of male gatekeeping turned it into a weapon. Now we’re here, unpicking it all and realising—<em>we could’ve had the key to heaven on earth this whole time.</em></p>
