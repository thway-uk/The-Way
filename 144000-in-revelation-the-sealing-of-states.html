<h1>144,000 in Revelation: The Sealing of States</h1>
<p>The number 144,000 mentioned in the Book of Revelation has often sparked fascination and confusion. Many traditional interpretations suggest it refers to a literal number of people to be saved during the end times. However, when we approach Revelation through the teachings of Neville Goddard, a very different, far more empowering meaning emerges.</p><p>Neville consistently taught that the Bible is not a historical record or a prophecy of worldly events, but rather a psychological drama — a blueprint of individual spiritual awakening. Revelation, like the rest of Scripture, symbolises the transformation of our inner world. Salvation, in Neville’s terms, is never about saving people from external calamities. It is about saving yourself from ignorance — from the false belief that you are separate from God.</p><h2>Numbers as Symbols of Inner States</h2><p>In Neville’s understanding, numbers in the Bible are not statistical; they are symbolic. They point to qualities of consciousness, stages of inner growth, and the structure of divine realisation.</p><p>The number 144,000 is rich with symbolic meaning:</p><p>Twelve is the number of divine order, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">spiritual government</a>, and completeness — seen throughout scripture in the <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-summary-law-of-assumption.html">twelve tribes of Israel</a>, the <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-and-twelve-disciple.html">twelve apostles</a>, and the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem. Twelve times twelve intensifies this completeness, representing a multiplication of spiritual authority. One thousand signifies magnitude, fullness, and complete realisation.</p><p>Thus, 144,000 symbolises the full, complete awakening of all aspects of the human soul — the total sealing of the mind in the awareness of divine truth.</p><h2>The Sealing of Consciousness</h2><p>When Revelation speaks of the 144,000 being sealed, Neville would interpret this not as a marking on the forehead of chosen individuals, but as the sealing of faculties within your own consciousness.</p><p>Each of us carries spiritual faculties — qualities such as faith, love, wisdom, imagination, strength, will, understanding, praise, discernment, power, order, generativity, and life. These correspond to the twelve tribes of Israel and represent dimensions of the self that must be brought under divine direction. To be "sealed" is to awaken and align each of these aspects so that your entire being is fixed in the knowledge that “I AM” is the only creative power.</p><h2>Elohim as Judges and Rulers: States of Awareness Governing the Mind</h2><p>At the very heart of this spiritual unfolding is the name <strong>Elohim</strong>, first introduced in Genesis. Elohim is a plural word, often translated as <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">"God," but more accurately meaning <em>judges</em> or <em>rulers</em></a>. This plurality suggests not a single distant deity but a convening of divine states of awareness — the inner faculties that judge, decide, and govern the mind.</p><p>In the psychological reading, Elohim represents the collective of your inner faculties coming together as the ruling assembly within you. They determine the direction of your attention, the states you inhabit, and ultimately the reality you experience. When you allow these inner "rulers" to act unconsciously, they create chaos and division. But when each faculty is sealed in the awareness that your imagination is God, they work in perfect harmony to express your chosen state.</p><p>Just as the 144,000 symbolise the sealing of all aspects of consciousness, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God — Elohim</a> symbolises the unified council of all your inner judges coming into alignment. Instead of scattered or competing assumptions, your mind becomes a single, harmonised divine government.</p><h2>Awakening to Your Divine Nature</h2><p>In Neville’s vision, the journey of life is the journey of spiritual memory. You are not becoming something new; you are remembering what you have always been. The sealing of the 144,000 represents the final stages of this remembering — when every part of you knows and lives the truth that your imagination is God.</p><p>The moment all aspects of your mind are aligned with this truth, you are no longer a divided house. You become the New Jerusalem — the holy city not made with hands — descending into full experience.</p><p>In short:<br />
The 144,000 symbolise the complete inner awakening of your consciousness. They represent every faculty of mind sealed in the awareness that your imagination is God. And Elohim — the judges and rulers — symbolise the states of consciousness convening to govern your inner world, finally unified under the one true law: “I AM.”</p>
