    <h1>Eternity in the Heart: Ecclesiastes 3:11</h1>
    <p><strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11 (ESV)</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><em>"He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end."</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><p>God — your own wonderful human imagination — has placed within you <strong>eternity</strong>.<br />
This does not mean an infinite stretch of time. In Neville Goddard’s teaching, <strong>eternity</strong> is the <strong>timeless reality of being</strong> — the complete pattern of fulfilment, encoded beyond the reach of the senses. It is the <strong>Alpha and Omega</strong>, already complete, planted like a seed in the subconscious mind.</p><p>You were not sent here to <strong>study</strong> the plan of God as though it were a visible blueprint.<br />
You were sent to <strong>live it</strong>, to <strong>feel it</strong>, to <strong>become it</strong>.</p><p>The outer man — the reasoning mind — cannot trace what God (Imagination) has done “from the beginning to the end,” because the process of spiritual awakening is not rational.<br />
It is <strong>symbolic</strong>, <strong>psychological</strong>, and <strong>experiential</strong>.</p><p>The mystery is <strong>intentionally veiled</strong> from logic.<br />
It cannot be reduced to a doctrine or decoded through analysis.<br />
It unfolds as <strong>states of consciousness</strong> which you pass through, often without knowing their full meaning until you emerge transformed.</p><p>To walk by imagination is to move through this mystery — step by step — trusting the feeling of the fulfilled wish rather than the evidence of the senses.</p><p>The whole pattern is already in place.<br />
But like the child in the womb, you do not know how the bones grow.<br />
The process is <strong>hidden from the intellect</strong>, yet <strong>alive within the heart</strong>.</p><hr /><p><strong>The story is finished — but hidden.</strong><br />
The eternal has been placed within you,<br />
not to be observed from the outside,<br />
but to be realised from within.</p><p>You do not uncover it by logic.<br />
You <strong>become</strong> it through assumption.</p>
