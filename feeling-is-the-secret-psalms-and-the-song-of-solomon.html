    <h1>Feeling Is the Secret: Psalms and the Song of Solomon</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard famously taught that the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">essence of creation lies in <em>feeling</em></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Many interpret this as a call to gratitude and humility. While gratitude is part of the path, Neville’s deeper insight — illuminated beautifully in Scripture — is about <em>entering and living the feeling of identity and dominion itself</em>. The feeling that the Song of Solomon so vividly captures is the very state Neville pointed to as the secret.</p><p>At the heart of this story is <strong>Judah</strong>, symbolised as the lion and the holder of the sceptre. He is the ‘He’ of the Song, the beloved, the one with whom the soul—the bride—unites. This union is not abstract; it is intense adoration, a feeling so rich it becomes a lived reality.</p><p>Consider this declaration of mutual possession:</p><blockquote>
<p><em><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM</a> my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies.”</em> (Song 6:3)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the perfect picture of Neville’s “feeling is the secret.” It is the felt experience of belonging fully to a state of consciousness that holds power, adoration and fulfilment. The soul recognises itself in Judah, the lion that's harnessed its dominion and now uses it in reverence.</p><p>The Song further invites us into the embrace of this state:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.”</em> (Song 2:6)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here is the posture of rest in the imagined state, secure and cherished. It is not striving but dwelling. Neville’s teaching is not about chasing or begging the world; it is about <em>being</em> claimed by the state you desire until it becomes your natural condition.</p><p>This identity is whole and flawless:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.”</em> (Song 4:7)</p>
</blockquote><p>To live the feeling is to see yourself as perfect in the assumed role, because it is through this belief and feeling that your reality is shaped.</p><p>Praise and creative invocation permeate the Song:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere.”</em> (Song 4:16)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the spirit of Judah’s sovereign  adoration calling forth the inner creative winds to awaken the garden of imagination. Praise is not mere humility; it is the powerful atmosphere that maintains the state of devotion.</p><p>Finally, the Song bursts with the joy of fulfilled desire:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.”</em> (Song 5:1)</p>
</blockquote><p>Neville taught that the feeling of the wish fulfilled is sensory, emotional, and real—this passage invites us to live that delight in fullness.</p><p>Though unnamed in the Song, Judah’s symbolism as the lion and sceptre-holder shines through the imagery of sovereign strength and intimate union:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved?”</em> (Song 8:5)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the soul resting confidently in the power of its assumed identity—leaning on Judah, the embodiment of dominion and intimate praise.</p><hr /><h3>Psalms: The Power of ‘I AM’ and the Depth of Feeling</h3><p>While the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> immerses us in the <em>felt experience</em> of fulfilled desire and intimate union, the <strong>Psalms</strong> offer a profound companion to Neville’s teaching by grounding feeling in the living reality of the “I Am.”</p><p>The psalmist boldly declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.”</em> (Psalm 23:1)</p>
</blockquote><p>This is a powerful “I AM” statement — an <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">identity assumed in consciousness</a>. The psalm does not just state facts but floods the soul with feeling: trust, security, and peace.</p><p>In Psalms, feeling and identity walk hand in hand. The speaker’s “I aM” is a conscious claim, a declaration of who they are in relationship to the divine presence. Yet this declaration is never dry or distant; it vibrates with raw, authentic emotion—sometimes joy, sometimes anguish, always real.</p><p>Consider:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”</em> (Psalm 51:10)</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, the yearning to embody a pure “I AM” is drenched in heartfelt feeling, showing that transformation is both an inner state of being <em>and</em> a deeply felt experience.</p><p>Neville’s “feeling is the secret” aligns perfectly with this: the <em>I AM</em> is the centre of identity, but it is brought alive by the feeling that flows through the psalms’ poetry.</p><p>Together, the Psalms and the Song of Solomon show us how to embody Neville’s teaching fully:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Psalms</strong> remind us to claim our “I Am” with boldness, enlivened by heartfelt feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Song of Solomon</strong> invites us to luxuriate in the intimate, fulfilled feeling of <em>already being</em> what we desire.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In this way, the Bible’s poetry unfolds the full spectrum of Neville’s secret — feeling and identity as one living reality.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: The Secret of Feeling, the Lion’s Dominion, and the Song’s Embrace</h3><p>Neville Goddard revealed that the true power of creation lies not in external effort, but in <em>dwelling fully in the feeling</em> of the wish fulfilled. This feeling is not merely gratefulness or humility; it is the bold, sovereign state of identity and possession, as beautifully embodied in Judah — the lion and sceptre-holder of the biblical story.</p><p>The <strong>Song of Solomon</strong> gives us a poetic blueprint of this secret feeling: mutual belonging, secure embrace, flawless identity, and joyous praise. It invites us to enter that sacred space where the soul rests confidently in its imagined reality, leaning on its beloved—its true self made manifest.</p><p>As Rumi, the mystic poet who so deeply understood the language of feeling and union, said:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Close your eyes, fall in love, stay there.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the invitation. To close your eyes to the world of appearances, to fall in love with the imagined state of fulfilment, and to stay there—living fully in the secret that feeling <em>is</em> the creative power.</p>
