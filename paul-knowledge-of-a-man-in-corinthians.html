<h1>Paul: Knowledge of a Man in Corinthians</h1>
<p>In <strong>2 Corinthians 12:1–6</strong>, Paul speaks of his experiences and the deeper mysteries he has encountered. Through this passage, we can glean profound insights into the nature of spiritual elevation and the power of the assumption — the act of fully embracing a new state of being. Let’s unpack this passage, revealing the wisdom hidden within these verses.</p>
<hr />
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:1</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"As it is, it is not good for me to take pride: but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Paul sets the stage by reminding us that true spiritual advancement isn’t about external recognition. He invites us to focus not on worldly pride but on the power of <em>visions</em> and <em>revelations</em> — in Neville Goddard's terms, the assumption of the desired state. The "visions" Paul speaks of are akin to those inner imaginings, the assumptions we make about ourselves that elevate us spiritually. By keeping our focus on these internal revelations, we avoid getting caught up in worldly pride or distractions.</p>
<hr />
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:2 NIV</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I have knowledge of a man in Christ, fourteen years back (in the body, or out of the body, I am not able to say, God only knows), who was taken up to the third heaven."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "man in Christ" is the new assumption, the new "I am" that we embody when we fully embrace the creative power of our imagination. Whether this experience happens internally or externally doesn’t matter — only the consistency of staying in the assumption leads us to the highest state, represented as the "third heaven." This is the state of divine manifestation, the place where all things become possible through the imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:3–4 KJV</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"And I have knowledge of such a <b>man</b> (whether in the body or out of the body, I am not able to say, God only knows), who was taken up into Paradise, and had word of secret things which might not be said, which <b>man</b> may not put into words."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "<a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a>" here represents the state of consciousness in alignment with divine truth. This state experiences "Paradise" — the fullness of imagination realised. The "secret things" refers to the secret nature in which imagination works. These are the deep revelations that arise when we truly embody a new assumption. The old man, bound by limitation, cannot fathom these truths, but the new <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">man</a>, aligned with the imagination, experiences them in their fullness.</p>
<hr />
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"On account of such a one I will have glory: for myself I will take no glory, but only in my pain."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>True glory comes not from boasting in worldly achievements but from fully realising the new assumption. To "have glory" is to immerse oneself in the power of the imagination, fully embodying the assumed state. We must avoid reveling in the old man, which keeps us tied to past identities and struggles. Instead, we are to find glory in the act of assuming the new self, regardless of external circumstances.</p>
<hr />
<h4>2 Corinthians 12:6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"For if I had a mind to take glory to myself, I would not be foolish; for I would be saying what is true: but I will keep from it, so that no man may put a higher value on me than he sees in me or has knowledge of me."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul here emphasizes that even if he were to boast, the truth of the assumption would be evident. But he chooses not to, so that others don’t mistakenly elevate him based on outward appearances. In the context of Neville Goddard’s teachings, this serves as a reminder that the true power of the imagination lies within. We need not seek validation from the world but remain rooted in the assumption of our desired state. The truth of our internal transformation will be clear to those who are perceptive, without the need for external validation.</p>

<h3>The Double Dreams: Joseph’s Story and Paul’s "God Only Knows" in Neville's Framework</h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, Joseph’s double dreams symbolize the power of <em>persistent assumption</em>. The repetition of his dreams — of his brothers’ sheaves and celestial bodies bowing to him — emphasizes the need to consistently imagine and feel the desired end as if it has already occurred. This persistent imagining is key to manifestation.</p>
<p>Similarly, Paul’s repeated phrase, <em>"<a href="/2025/05/the-significance-of-god-knows-and-power.html">God only knows</a>,"</em> in <strong>2 Corinthians 12:2-4</strong> underscores the certainty of divine knowledge and the subconscious mind’s role in creation. The statement <em>"<a href="/2025/05/the-significance-of-god-knows-and-power.html">God only knows</a>"</em> refers to the importance of only entertaining the new assumption, or the "<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>," as the only reality. By repeating this, Paul highlights that the outcome is already set when we stay fully focused on the assumption of our desired state. Much like Joseph’s repeated dreams reinforcing his destined rise to power, both statements emphasize the importance of unwavering assumption — imagining the desired end persistently, trusting that the subconscious will bring it to fruition.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: The Power of Assumption</h3>
<p>Through 2 Corinthians 12:1–6, Paul teaches us the importance of internal elevation and the power of imagination. To "glory" in our assumption is to fully embrace our new self without being swayed by external circumstances or the validation of others. The man in Christ — our new identity — is not limited by the body or outward conditions. It is a state of consciousness that transcends worldly concerns and enters into the divine creative power of imagination.</p>
<p>As we continue to live from the assumption of our desired state, we embody this new self, experiencing a transformation that is beyond words, taking us to our own "third heaven" — a state of spiritual and creative fulfillment. In doing so, we become the true manifestation of our highest potential.</p>
