    <h1>Jesus Walks on Water</h1>
    <p>The story of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> walking on <a href="/2025/05/mem-hebrew-letter-meanint-water-and.html">water</a> is not a tale of physical defiance of nature—it is a spiritual allegory describing what happens when imagination is consciously assumed rather than reactively disturbed. According to Neville Goddard, every character, place, and event in Scripture represents states of consciousness. In this drama, we are shown what occurs when the awakened “I AM” walks above the <a href="/2025/05/zebulunthe-sea-honour-and-dwelling.html">stormy sea</a> of reaction, and how the disciplined use of imagination brings stillness to the mind.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Sea as the Subconscious</strong></h2>
<p>In <strong>Matthew 14:22–33</strong>, the disciples are in a boat “tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.” This sea is not external—it is the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, filled with movement and unrest. The boat represents personal consciousness trying to hold steady amidst emotional currents. When the imagination reacts to appearances—when the mind accepts fear as real—the sea becomes wild.</p>
<p>Neville taught, <em>“The world is a mirror, forever reflecting what you are doing within yourself.”</em> These waves are not the problem themselves—they are the result of undirected inner activity. They reflect the assumptions and emotional states one has allowed to take root.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Wind as the Misused Breath of God</strong></h2>
<p>The passage tells us the <a href="/2025/04/breath-cloud-and-whirlwind-symbolism-of.html">wind</a> was contrary. In Biblical symbolism, <strong>wind</strong> is not simply atmospheric—<strong>it is Spirit</strong>. In <strong>Genesis 1:2</strong>, “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters”—and that word “spirit” is the Hebrew <strong>ruach</strong>, meaning <a href="/search/label/Breath%20Series"><strong>wind</strong>, <strong>breath</strong>, or <strong>spirit</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Neville reminds us that <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> is <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>, and what Genesis is describing is the <strong>movement of consciousness over the subconscious</strong>. When directed with faith and awareness, the breath (spirit) brings order and light. When misdirected—when based on fear, reaction, or doubt—it stirs up chaos.</p>
<p>According to the <strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers table of Hebrew letters</a></strong>, the first letter <strong>Aleph (א)</strong> corresponds to the number <strong>1</strong>, and symbolises <strong>breath, air, and the silent creative force</strong>. It is the unsounded power behind all sound—the <strong>I AM</strong> behind all states.</p>
<p>To live in the Law of Assumption is to dwell in <strong>Aleph</strong>—the <strong>silent knowing</strong> that your assumption is reality. But when one begins to doubt, to react, to take the wind (Spirit) as an opposition instead of as their own breath misapplied—they fall, just as Peter sinks.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Fourth Watch: Awakening to I AM</strong></h2>
<p>The text says Jesus came to them “in the <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-fourfold-path-how-patriarchs.html">fourth</a> watch of the night</strong>.” This is not just a time-stamp—it is deep symbolic language. The fourth watch (between 3 AM and 6 AM) is the moment just before dawn, the breaking of new awareness.</p>
<p>According to Roman division, the night had four watches:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Evening (6–9 PM)</strong> – Descent into passivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Midnight (9–12)</strong> – Deep unconsciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cockcrow (12–3 AM)</strong> – Stirring of self-awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Morning watch (3–6 AM)</strong> – <strong>Awakening to conscious assumption</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In Hebrew, the <a href="/search/label/Numbers%3A%20Four">number <strong>4</strong></a> corresponds to the letter <strong>Daleth (ד)</strong>, meaning <strong>door</strong>. Jesus appearing at the <strong>fourth watch</strong> is the arrival of <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> at the door</strong>—the threshold of new assumption. The storm doesn’t stop first—<strong>awareness arrives first</strong>, and the chaos begins to still as the mind fixes itself on truth.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Jesus Walking: The Mastery of Consciousness</strong></h2>
<p>Jesus walking on water is imagination in command—<strong>I AM not reacting to appearance</strong>, but standing upon it. The water beneath him is the <strong>subconscious</strong>, the waves are the <strong>feelings</strong>, and the wind is the <strong>breath of belief</strong>.</p>
<p>This walking is not physical. It is symbolic of <strong>persisting in the assumption of the wish fulfilled</strong> regardless of emotional turbulence.</p>
<p>Peter, one of the <a href="/2025/05/the-calling-of-twelve-gospel-story.html">twelve supporting aspects of mind</a>, says, “Lord, if it be thou, bid me come,” and he steps out. For a moment, he assumes the state—he walks on water. But the moment he “sees the wind,” he begins to sink. That is, the moment one’s attention shifts from the desired state to circumstances, the assumption collapses. Neville taught, <em>“You must remain faithful to your assumption, even though the world contradicts it.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Stillness Comes When I AM is Accepted</strong></h2>
<p>When Jesus enters the boat, the wind ceases. This is not weather changing—it is <strong>inner silence restored</strong>. The storm is never “out there.” It is the reflection of a mind tossed between belief and doubt. When “Jesus”—the awareness of being—is re-centred, the subconscious (sea) responds.</p>
<p>It is a return to <strong>Aleph</strong>, the breath of still knowing. The wind is no longer contrary—it becomes <strong>the breath of life</strong>, the Spirit rightly directed.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: Return to the Silent Breath</strong></h2>
<p>The story of Jesus walking on water is a psychological demonstration of <strong>inner control</strong>, not outer power. It is not a call to test gravity, but to <strong>master feeling</strong> and <strong>remain in the assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>When the wind blows and waves rise, it is your own spirit reacting against you. But when you remember that <strong>Aleph—the breath, the I AM is your core</strong>, the storm calms. And the moment you say within yourself, “Be still,” all things obey the state you have accepted as true.</p>
