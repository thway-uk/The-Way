<h1>Proverbs 6:20-35 — Interpreted through Neville Goddard’s Teachings</h1>
<p><strong>Verse 20: “My son, keep your father's command, and do not forsake the law of your mother.”</strong></p>
<p>Neville Goddard often speaks of the importance of aligning the conscious and subconscious mind. In this verse, the "father's command" represents the <strong>conscious mind</strong>, which directs your actions, while the "law of your mother" represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, where beliefs and emotional patterns are stored. The message here is clear: align both the conscious and subconscious mind with your desired state.</p>
<p>When your thoughts (father) and emotions (mother) are in harmony, you can create the life you desire. To manifest effectively, you must constantly keep your imagination in alignment with your true desires, not allowing either your conscious or subconscious mind to stray.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 21: “Bind them continually upon your heart, tie them around your neck.”</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville's teachings, "binding them upon your heart" means internalizing your desires and beliefs so deeply that they become a part of your core identity. The heart represents the emotional center, and tying wisdom or guidance around your neck signifies constant reminder and focus.</p>
<p><strong>This verse reflects Neville’s idea of persistently holding onto your ideal state</strong>. By doing so, you constantly remind yourself of what you desire and stay attuned to the creative power of your imagination. Your desires must be held close to your heart and remain present in your thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 22: “When you go, it will lead you; when you sleep, it will keep you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often emphasizes that your imagination is always working, even when you are unaware of it. <strong>What you impress upon your subconscious mind will guide you, even during your sleep.</strong> The desires you focus on, whether consciously or subconsciously, create your reality.</p>
<p>As Neville teaches, <strong>your imagination never rests</strong>. It is always at work, molding the circumstances of your life. When you go through your day, your desires will lead you; when you sleep, your subconscious mind continues to work on your behalf; and upon waking, it will bring forth insights and inspirations aligned with your ideal state.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 23: “For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; reproofs of instruction are the way of life.”</strong></h3>
<p>This verse speaks to the guiding nature of wisdom. <strong>In Neville's terms, the commandment (your "I Am" and desire) is like a light that illuminates the path to your manifestation.</strong> Your imagination is the light, and the instructions (mental discipline) help you stay on course.</p>
<p><strong>The “reproofs of instruction”</strong> represent the lessons and realizations that come from experiences—whether positive or negative. Neville often said that you learn most through the contrast between what you desire and what you currently experience. These reproofs are part of the manifestation journey, guiding you back to alignment with your higher self.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 24: “To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattering tongue of a strange woman.”</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, <strong>the “evil woman” represents distractions and negative thoughts</strong> that pull your attention away from your desired outcome. The “flattering tongue” symbolizes the seductive nature of negative suggestions, fears, or doubts that seem appealing but lead you away from your true desires.</p>
<p><strong>This verse urges you to guard your imagination against these negative influences</strong>. Neville teaches that <strong>you must avoid thoughts that are in conflict with your desires</strong>. The subconscious mind is impressionable, and allowing negative thoughts (the flattering tongue) can misdirect your focus and impede your manifestation process.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 25: “Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, nor let her allure you with her eyelids.”</strong></h3>
<p>Here, the "lust" is not about physical attraction but represents <strong>the subconscious desire for something that pulls you away from your true purpose</strong>. Neville Goddard teaches that <strong>your imagination must remain focused on your desired state</strong>, not on fleeting distractions or desires that don't align with your higher goals.</p>
<p>When you "lust" after something that isn't in line with your ideal state, you are misdirecting your creative energy. <strong>This is a warning to keep your imagination focused on what you truly desire, and not on things that merely appeal to the senses or fleeting desires.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 26: “For by means of a harlot a man is reduced to a crust of bread; and the adulteress will prey upon his precious life.”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville often explains that <strong>misdirected imagination leads to loss</strong>—whether that’s a sense of purpose, direction, or material abundance. In this verse, the “harlot” represents <strong>misguided thoughts and desires</strong> that lead to a depletion of your creative energy.</p>
<p>When you allow your imagination to dwell on negative or conflicting thoughts, you <strong>"lose" your creative power</strong>. Instead of focusing on what you truly want, you become distracted by external illusions, and your energy is drained. This causes a “reduction” of your potential and leads to unnecessary struggles.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 27: “Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville teaches that <strong>you cannot expect a positive outcome when you consistently direct your imagination toward negativity</strong>. Just as taking fire to your bosom will inevitably burn you, so too will focusing on thoughts that contradict your desires create undesired results.</p>
<p>Your thoughts and imagination are creative forces. <strong>If you focus on fear, doubt, or worry, you are setting yourself up for experiences that reflect those emotions.</strong> The key to manifestation is consistently aligning your imagination with your ideal outcome and refusing to entertain anything less.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 28: “Can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?”</strong></h3>
<p>This reinforces the idea that <strong>negative thoughts or emotions cannot be entertained without consequences</strong>. If you indulge in mental patterns that contradict your desires, it is like walking on hot coals: <strong>you will suffer the effects of that misalignment</strong>.</p>
<p>Neville would say that if you focus on thoughts that are out of alignment with your desire, you are essentially "scorching" yourself—creating emotional or material pain. <strong>To avoid this, stay disciplined in your thoughts and align them with what you truly want.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 29: “So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.”</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville’s terms, <strong>“touching” represents focusing on something that is not yours to focus on—an idea or desire that doesn't align with your true purpose</strong>. When you direct your attention and energy toward something external or unrelated to your own desires, you are misusing your creative power. <strong>This verse serves as a warning against misdirecting your focus.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 30: “People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.”</strong></h3>
<p>This verse speaks to the <strong>human tendency to justify actions when needs are not met</strong>. Neville often says that <strong>our desires are natural</strong>, and pursuing them is not wrong. However, misusing the imagination—like stealing to satisfy a need—leads to unhealthy manifestations.</p>
<p>The key is to focus on manifesting from a place of abundance, not lack. <strong>Neville teaches that you should never feel desperate or deprived in the manifestation process</strong>; instead, focus on what you desire from a place of self-assuredness and alignment with your highest self.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 31: “Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold; he may have to give up all the substance of his house.”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville would interpret this as the <strong>inevitable consequences of misusing the imagination</strong>. If you allow your thoughts to stray from your true desires, you will experience an imbalance that must be corrected. <strong>This is the “sevenfold” return—your misdirected thoughts will come back as negative experiences that you must reconcile.</strong></p>
<p>The "substance of his house" can be seen as the energy and resources (both mental and material) you expend when you're not in alignment with your true desires. To correct this, you must restore your focus and realign with what you truly want.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 32: “Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; he who does so destroys his own soul.”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville teaches that <strong>to act out of alignment with your true desires—especially by focusing on external things that are not in harmony with your imagination—leads to self-destruction</strong>. When you engage in these misaligned thoughts or actions, you are <strong>damaging your inner self</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 33: “Wounds and dishonor he will get, and his reproach will not be wiped away.”</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville’s framework, <strong>the wound is self-inflicted</strong>—a result of misusing the imagination. When you fail to direct your imagination toward your desires, you “miss the mark” and create emotional wounds that are difficult to heal. This dishonor is the consequence of straying from your true path.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 34: “For jealousy is a husband's fury; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.”</strong></h3>
<p>Neville explains that <strong>jealousy arises when we focus on what others have, rather than focusing on our own desires</strong>. This emotional reaction can cause turmoil and conflict in the manifestation process. To avoid this, Neville teaches to focus only on your own desires and not compare yourself to others.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Verse 35: “He will not accept any recompense; nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.”</strong></h3>
<p>This final verse speaks to the <strong>stubbornness of misdirected thoughts</strong>—once you’ve allowed your imagination to stray, it can be difficult to realign with your desires, especially if you've focused on negativity for a long time. <strong>The key is to correct your thoughts as soon as possible, so that you can restore harmony and begin to manifest from a place of alignment.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Proverbs 6:20-35, when interpreted through Neville Goddard’s teachings, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of <strong>maintaining control over your imagination</strong> and focusing on your desires with clarity and discipline. Misguided thoughts and distractions can lead to self-sabotage, emotional wounds, and negative manifestations.</p>
<p>By aligning your conscious and subconscious mind, staying true to your desires, and consistently focusing on positive outcomes, you can avoid these pitfalls and create the life you truly want.</p>
