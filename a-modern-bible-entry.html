    <h1>A Modern Bible Entry</h1>
    <p><strong>The Scroll of Veilash, Chapter 3</strong></p><ol>
<li>
<p>And in the days when men hewed altars of stone and prayed toward words they could not feel, a stirring began in the house of Eliam, son of the Quiet Hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His youngest, Imra, kept not to the customs. She asked what could not be answered and smiled at shadows as though they were signs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She dreamed beneath fig trees and spoke to stars without sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And a desire rose in her—wordless, weightless, yet sharp as flint: a shape of joy unformed, but certain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And she held it as one holds breath in the chest, not letting it escape before its time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the seventh month, while the elders counted prophecies like coins, she walked by the river alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And her thought fell into the waters, and the current did not carry it away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For it sank not as stone, but rooted like seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then came the season of stillness, when nothing moved but the inward flame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And in that silence, her countenance changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the vision had begun to press outward, as olives beneath the stone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In time, the thing long held in secret showed itself—not as thunder, but as a door left open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the house was filled with what she had once only whispered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And those who passed by said, “Surely this is coincidence,” though they could not explain the taste of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scribes returned to their scrolls and found no footnote for what had bloomed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And some whispered that she had tampered with mysteries forbidden,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Eliam only said, “What is forbidden to the blind is plain to those who see.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Imra dwelt in the city, but not of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For she had touched the thread that runs beneath appearances, and once touched, it does not fray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And a few came to her at night—ashamed, curious, trembling—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And she told them not to seek signs, but to become them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they went away changed, though they knew not why.</p></li></ol>
