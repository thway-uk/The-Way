<h1>Evidence the Bible Cannot Be Understood Literally</h1>
<p>There are countless stories, characters, and events in the Bible that simply do not make sense when read as literal or historical accounts. From talking serpents to parting seas, to genealogies that defy logic—these elements were never meant to be taken at face value.</p><p>The true narrative of the Bible begins to emerge only when it is approached as a work of <strong>psychological symbolism</strong>. Each figure is a state of consciousness. Each event is a movement of the inner world. The Bible does not record history—it reveals the <strong>pattern of awakening</strong>.</p><p>What appears bizarre or contradictory on the surface often holds profound meaning when viewed inwardly. That meaning is not imposed—it is <em>discovered</em>, when one begins to see the Bible as the map of the soul.</p><p><strong>The evidence for this symbolic reading is presented throughout this website</strong>, offering clarity on passages that defy literal understanding and revealing how these ancient stories mirror the journey of manifestation and self-realisation.</p><p>The author has also recently experienced scripture in the same way Neville Goddard described—<em>not as doctrine memorised, but as revelation unfolding within</em>—profound and personal.</p>
