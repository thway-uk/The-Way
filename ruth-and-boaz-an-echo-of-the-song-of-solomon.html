    <h1>Ruth and Boaz: An Echo of the Song of Solomon</h1>
    <p>The story of Ruth and Boaz is often seen as a simple love story, but it also symbolises a deep inner process of creation. In Neville Goddard’s interpretation, Boaz represents the conscious mind (“<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>”), and <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">Ruth symbolises the imaginative mind</a>. Together, they show the reader how <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">assumption and acceptance produce new reality.</a></p><hr /><h2>Ruth: The Imaginative Mind, Open and Trusting</h2><p></p><blockquote>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” — Genesis 2:24</blockquote><p></p><p>Ruth chooses to <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">leave her old life behind</a> and <a href="/2025/05/ruths-loyalty-and-naomis-rebirth.html">follow Naomi to Bethlehem</a>. This shows the imaginative mind turning away from old states and preparing to receive a new direction. The story of Ruth and Boaz is a <b><a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">enactment of the foundational verse of love</a></b> - Genesis 2:24</p><p>When she says, <em>"Your God shall be my God,"</em> she signals her willingness to take on a new identity.</p><p>Like the bride in the <a href="/search/label/Song%20of%20Solomon%20Series">Song of Solomon</a> who declares, <em>"My beloved is mine, and <a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a> his,"</em> Ruth quietly aligns herself without force. She embodies trust and faith rather than striving.</p><p>Her gleaning in the fields represents the imaginative mind receiving impressions patiently and faithfully. She does not command the harvest; she trusts that favour will find her.</p><hr /><h2>Boaz: The Conscious Mind, Strong and Assured</h2><p>Boaz symbolises the conscious mind — the part that assumes and directs. He notices Ruth’s devotion and responds with kindness and favour.</p><p>Boaz embodies the power of assumption: strong, steady, and unwavering. He holds the image of the fulfilled desire firmly and acts from that state.</p><p>His kindness and protection echo the beloved in Song of Solomon, who steadfastly cherishes and pursues the bride. Boaz acts as though Ruth’s request is already granted, allowing her trust to blossom into fulfilment.</p><hr /><h2>The Gleaning Field: The Inner Garden</h2><p>The field where Ruth gleans symbolises the inner world. Here, the conscious mind sows, and the imaginative mind gathers.</p><p>Ruth’s gentle presence and Boaz’s permission represent the harmony between conscious direction and imaginative receptivity. The field becomes a quiet inner garden where seeds of desire are nurtured.</p><hr /><h2>The Threshing Floor: Union and Conception</h2><div><blockquote>and they shall be one flesh.” — Genesis 2:24</blockquote></div><p>When Ruth lies at Boaz’s feet on the <a href="/2025/05/the-symbolism-of-threshing-floor-place.html">threshing floor</a>, it symbolises complete union. The imaginative mind yields fully to the conscious assumption.</p><p>Ruth’s request — <em>"<a href="/2025/05/the-symbolism-of-clothing-in-bible.html">Spread your garment</a> over me, for you are a redeemer"</em> — is the imaginative mind accepting the conscious desire as fact. This is the moment of inner conception, where creation begins.</p><hr /><h2>The Birth of Obed: Manifestation Made Visible</h2><p>Their union leads to the birth of Obed, symbolising the manifested desire. Obed’s place in the <a href="/2025/05/the-lineage-of-christ-journey-through.html">lineage of David and Christ</a> suggests that a single, faithfully held assumption can shape an entirely new destiny.</p><hr /><h2>The Inner Marriage: Conscious and Imaginative in Harmony</h2><p>Ruth represents the imaginative mind: trusting, open, and ready to receive. Boaz is the conscious mind: decisive and strong, assuming the wish fulfilled.</p><p>When these two work together — when the imaginative mind accepts the conscious assumption as real — manifestation is inevitable.</p><p>This story is also a sacred love story within: the conscious mind as the beloved who holds firm, and the imaginative mind as the bride who responds in trust. When this union is complete, life unfolds in form, favour, and fulfilment.</p>
