    <h1>The Egyptian Echo in Genesis</h1>
    <blockquote><p>“In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth.” — Genesis 1:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence of the Bible is both elegant and profound. But behind the word <strong>“<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>”</strong> is a Hebrew name filled with complexity: <strong>Elohim</strong> (אֱלֹהִים). It is plural in form, yet paired with singular verbs — a deliberate tension inviting the reader to <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">look deeper</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a simple reference to a distant deity, but a poetic gesture toward something eternal, active, and far closer than we’ve been led to believe: <strong>consciousness itself</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Creation Begins in Mind</strong></h2>
<p>Long before the Western world divided spirit and matter, ancient civilisations intuited that creation was not mechanical, but <strong>mental</strong>. In Egypt, the god <strong>Ptah</strong> was said to have created the world by <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">imagining</a> it in his heart and speaking it into being. Similarly, the god <strong>Thoth</strong>, associated with writing, order, and wisdom, was regarded as the divine intellect — the cosmic mind whose <a href="/2025/04/creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">word</a> structured reality.</p>
<p>Egyptian cosmology, though filled with gods and symbols, ultimately points to this idea:<br />
<strong>All creation begins in thought.</strong></p>
<p>Genesis echoes this same principle. <em><a href="/2025/04/creating-with-scripture-word-of-god-and.html">Elohim</a> said</em>, and it was so. Light, sky, land, stars, creatures — all emerge not from effort, but from <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">speech</a>.<br />
But this is not vocal sound — it is the speech of <strong>conscious assumption</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Plural God Who Acts as One</strong></h2>
<p>The name <em>Elohim</em> contains a mystery. It is a plural noun — <em>gods</em> — yet consistently behaves grammatically as if it were singular. This suggests <strong>unity within multiplicity</strong>. In symbolic terms, it reveals that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>All manifestations come from one source — imagination —</strong><br />
but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That source expresses through a multitude of forms.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, <em>Elohim</em> is best understood not as a being outside you, but as your <strong>own wonderful human imagination</strong> — the creative power that shapes all things according to the assumptions held within.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“Let Us Make Man…” — The Dialogue Within</strong></h2>
<p>When <em>Elohim</em> says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us make <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man in our image</a>,”<br />
we are not reading a conversation between multiple sky gods, but witnessing the <strong>inner counsel of mind</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This plural voice is the internal process by which you imagine, feel, consider, and ultimately assume a new state of being. The “us” is <strong>thought, feeling, desire, vision — the facets of consciousness</strong> at work when a new reality is being formed.</p>
<p>It is this same process you engage each time you say, <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html"><em>I am rich</em>, <em>I am healed</em>, <em>I am free</em></a> — not out loud, but inwardly, as a conviction.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The Egyptian Echo: Thoth, Ptah, and the Word of Power</strong></h2>
<p>The parallels with Egyptian theology are striking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Thoth</strong>, god of wisdom, embodies the <em>word as law</em>. Whatever is conceived in his mind and declared becomes part of the cosmic structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ptah</strong>, creator god of Memphis, imagines with the heart and brings forth with the tongue — a divine image of imagination followed by spoken word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not different gods with different powers — they are <strong>symbolic descriptions of the same truth</strong>:<br />
<strong>Imagination is the creative force. Thought is divine. The word is power.</strong></p>
<p>And this same structure is present in Genesis. The Bible, far from being separate from these ancient insights, is a psychological text <strong>built on the same foundation</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Neville Goddard: The True Elohim Is You</strong></h2>
<p>Neville Goddard brings this understanding into sharp focus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God became man, that man may become God... The Elohim is not a being apart from you. It is your own imagination, creating your world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This changes everything. The Bible is not a record of historical miracles, but a symbolic guide to how <strong>you</strong> — through your assumptions — create heaven and earth in your own world.</p>
<p>Every “day” of creation in Genesis is not a time-based event, but a <strong>stage in the awakening of creative awareness</strong>. Each moment you assume something new about yourself, and persist, you are speaking as Elohim.</p>
<p>You are not calling upon a god — you are calling forth as God.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>“I AM” — The Name of the Creator Within</strong></h2>
<p>When Moses asks for the name of God in Exodus 3:14, he receives the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM THAT I AM</a>... tell them I AM has sent you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a name in the usual sense. It is a statement of being. It is <strong>pure consciousness</strong>. It is Elohim, stripped of symbol — made direct and immediate.</p>
<p>“I AM” is not something to say; it is something to realise. It is the core of all creation. Whatever you place after it — “I am lonely”, “I am blessed”, “I am powerful” — begins to shape your world.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Conclusion: Reading Genesis as Your Own Story</strong></h2>
<p>The opening of Genesis is not ancient history. It is a template for how your world is created every moment through <strong>imaginative assumption</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Elohim said...</em> — You imagine something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And it was so...</em> — Your world rearranges to reflect it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And it was good...</em> — You experience the fruit of your own state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The gods of Egypt, the Elohim of Genesis, and the “I AM” of Moses all point in one direction:<br />
<strong>The power to create is within.</strong><br />
Not metaphorically, not metaphorically — <strong>literally</strong>.<br />
Your imagination is the eternal creator. You are the voice of Elohim.</p>
