<h1>Moses and Jesus: The Rock and the Living Water</h1>
<p>The Bible shows our journey from dry, barren <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">states of mind</a> to the free flow of creative power. In <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">Genesis, dry land appears as the first stage of separation and structure</a>. In Exodus, Moses strikes the rock to release water — showing how rigid facts yield to the flow of imagining. In the New Testament, Jesus declares himself the living water, symbolising imagination flowing effortlessly from the rock of faith within. Through Neville’s eyes, these stories reveal the shift from forcing change to allowing it to flow naturally from the realised “I AM.”</p><hr /><p><strong>Exodus 17: The Rock Struck in the Wilderness</strong></p><p>In <em>Exodus 17</em>, the Israelites—newly freed from Egypt—wander a barren wilderness. They thirst, not merely for physical water, but for inner assurance, sustenance, and faith.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Moses</strong>, symbolising awakened yet tested consciousness, strikes the <strong>rock</strong>, and water flows forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>rock</strong> represents the hardened, externalised world of fact—the fixed beliefs and perceived limits of reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>water</strong>, by contrast, symbolises <strong>imagination</strong>—fluid, creative, and life-giving, yet here, trapped within form.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Moses striking the rock with his rod symbolises the act of focused faith confronting rigid appearances—revealing the latent power of imagination hidden beneath seeming limitation.</p><blockquote>
<p>This scene illustrates a timeless principle:<br />
What appears immovable (the rock) can be made to yield (flow) through applied inner certainty (the rod of faith).</p>
</blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Fulfilment in the New Testament: Peter and the Living Water</strong></p><p>The New Testament completes and spiritualises this pattern.</p><p><strong>Peter as the Rock</strong><br />
In <em>Matthew 16:18</em>, Jesus declares:</p><blockquote>
<p>“You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.”</p>
</blockquote><p>From Neville’s perspective, Peter symbolises the <strong>new, solidified faith</strong>—not in institutions, but in imagination as the creative reality.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>This rock is not the hardened mind of the old world but the steadfast knowing that the <strong>unseen creates the seen</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Jesus as the Living Water</strong><br />
In <em>John 4:14</em>, Jesus says:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</p>
</blockquote><p>In Neville’s teaching, Jesus is not a historical figure, but <strong>personified imagination</strong>—awakened and creative.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>living water</strong> is the flowing, nourishing movement of awareness itself—<strong>rising from within once faith is established</strong>.</p>

</table><hr /><p><strong>Conclusion: From Force to Flow</strong></p><p>The rock Moses strikes is a foreshadowing—a shadow of the greater fulfilment in Peter and Jesus:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In Exodus, imagination is hidden, requiring force to release it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the New Testament, <strong>faith has matured</strong>. Peter becomes the rock of conviction, and Jesus—the embodiment of imagination—releases living water <strong>through inner recognition</strong>, not external effort.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The veil has lifted. The hardened beliefs of the past give way to the flowing truth of awakened consciousness.</p><blockquote>
<p>What once required the rod of faith now flows freely from the <strong>realisation of “I AM.”</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the shift from outer drama to <strong>inner realisation</strong>—the heart of Neville’s message.</p><p></p><blockquote>And I saw a river of water of life, clear as glass, coming out of the high seat of God and of the Lamb" - Revelation 22:1</blockquote><p></p>
