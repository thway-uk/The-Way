    <h1>Saul: Not Found with Childlike Innocence</h1>
    <p>In <strong>1 Samuel 10:21</strong>, when Saul is "not found" among the tribe of Benjamin, it offers a profound lesson on the importance of <a href="/2025/04/childlike-faith-becoming-like-little.html">childlike</a> innocence in the process of manifestation, as understood through <strong>Neville Goddard’s Law of Assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Benjamin, whose name means "son of the right hand" or "son of my old age," symbolises innocence, purity, and <a href="/2025/04/childlike-faith-becoming-like-little.html">childlike</a> qualities in <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>. The fact that Saul is not found in Benjamin suggests a disconnect from these essential traits. Saul, in this context, represents the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html"><strong>old man</strong> we are trying to leave behind</a>, or the ego—the part of us that is reluctant to embrace the innocence, trust, and simplicity required for taking part in the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">law of Assumption</a>.</p>
<p>According to Neville, to manifest successfully through the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, one must return to a childlike state of mind. This means assuming the desired outcome with full faith, innocence, and without resistance or doubt. Just like a child who naturally believes in the unseen, the mind must trust its creative power without overthinking or questioning the process.</p>
<p>Saul’s initial hiding symbolises the struggle many of us face in reconnecting with this innocent, undistorted faith. The adult mind, shaped by doubts, fears, and the complexities of life, often loses touch with the purity needed to manifest desires. However, when Saul is eventually found and anointed as king, it reflects the process of returning to that innocent, trusting mindset—the moment when we embrace our creative power fully and without hesitation.</p>
<p>To manifest through the <strong>Law of Assumption</strong>, we must rediscover our childlike faith. The moment we do, we align ourselves with our highest potential, just as Saul, once found, steps into his role as king. The key to unlocking our power lies in returning to the simplicity of assuming our desires with the pure trust and innocence of a child.</p>
