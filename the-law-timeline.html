    <h1>The Law: TIMELINE</h1>
    <div style="text-align: left;">The Bible is a psychological pattern detailing the gradual implementation of the Law of Assumption. From Genesis to Revelation, it unfolds as a chronological journey of consciousness, showing the minds evolution from blind effort and outer dependence to <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">full mastery of imagination</a> and inner conviction. This timeline reveals not just stories, but the hidden steps of transformation each of us must walk to realise that <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">“I AM”</a> is the true source of all creation.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Law of Assumption: Bible Timeline</strong></h2><div>
