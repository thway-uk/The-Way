    <h1>The Testaments: Old to New — Outside to Inside</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a history book—it is a psychological drama, <a href="/2025/07/the-bibles-true-timeline-evolution-of.html">chronicling</a> your own spiritual evolution. The so-called “Old” and “New” Covenants are not timelines in ancient theology, but<strong> of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a></strong>. They reveal the journey from an external, ritualistic approach to the Divine, into a direct, inner relationship with the creative power of imagination.</p>
<p>We move from <strong>ritual</strong> to <strong>realisation</strong>. From <strong>mimicking the form</strong> to <strong>becoming the substance</strong>. From <strong>shadow</strong> to <strong>substance</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Old Covenant: Crude Symbolism and Ritual Law</h3>
<p>The Old Covenant represents a stage of consciousness still caught in the <strong>illusion of separation</strong>—between God and man, power and person, heaven and earth. At this level, the mind is still unwittingly interpreting life through ritual, ceremony, sacrifice, and law. Every action is symbolic, yet <strong>misunderstood as literal</strong>.</p>
<p>From a Nevillean lens, these rituals are primitive attempts to imitate the Law of Assumption. Burnt offerings, tabernacles, blood sacrifices, purification laws—each is a <strong>psychological metaphor</strong>, acted out <strong>externally</strong> because the inner understanding had not yet dawned.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2025/04/the-ten-commandments-interpreted-symbol.html">law was written <strong>on stone</strong></a>, not yet on the heart.</p>
<p>Religion, at this level, is distortion. It replaces <strong>inner transformation</strong> with <strong>outer obedience</strong>. It is the mind <strong>imitating</strong> the truth it cannot yet embody. People seek to <em>perform</em> faith rather than <em>be</em> it.</p>
<p>They <strong>assume that assumption</strong> is something done <em>to</em> God, not <em>as</em> God.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Ritual as Psychological Mimicry</h3>
<p>All religion begins in <strong>symbol</strong>. That is not inherently wrong—but it becomes dangerous when we believe the symbol <em>is</em> the thing. The temple is mistaken for the Presence. The lamb for innocence. The external altar for internal sacrifice.</p>
<p>In truth, these forms are rehearsals for something deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sacrifice = the surrender of the old self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleansing = a change in self-concept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Promised Land = the fulfilled assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circumcision = cutting away the outer man</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all attempts to <strong>externalise the Law of Assumption</strong>—to bring about change through <strong>ritual</strong>, rather than through <strong>inner conviction</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The New Covenant: The Embodied Mind</h3>
<p>By the time we arrive at the New Testament, the symbols dissolve. The parables point inward. Jesus appears—not as a man to be worshipped, but as the <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">personification of imagination actively healing itself</a>. He teaches <em>“The Kingdom of God is within you.”</em></p>
<p>This is the turning point: from law to <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">love</a>, from imitation to incarnation, from <strong>ritual</strong> to <strong>reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Now the law is no longer carved in stone or bound to ceremony. It is written in the <strong>mind</strong> and felt in the <strong>heart</strong>. It is imagination—consciousness itself—that becomes the temple, the priest, and the sacrifice.</p>
<p>As Neville would say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Dying to the old man is not ritual—it is imagining something new and living in it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>The Crucifixion: Ending the Old World</h3>
<p>The <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucifixion</a> is the <em>last ritual</em>. It is the death of the idea that God is outside of you. It ends the drama of separation. The cross is not punishment—it is the fixing of an assumption. The body of Jesus is your old concept of self, nailed down until it dies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It is finished.”</em><br />
—Not just the life of a man, but the <strong>age of external religion</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resurrection that follows is not about a body walking out of a tomb. It is the birth of a new awareness—one where <strong>you</strong> awaken as the creative power itself. <strong>You</strong> are the operant power. <strong>You</strong> are the Word made flesh.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Living the New Covenant: From Acting to Being</h3>
<p>To live under the New Covenant is to realise that <strong>the ritual is over</strong>. You are no longer burning offerings—you are offering up assumptions. You no longer cleanse your body—you purify your imagination. You no longer look to a priest—you speak <em>I AM</em> from within.</p>
<p>You don't assume to get something from God.<br />
You assume because <strong>you are God, imagining</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not arrogance. It is humility at its highest: the surrender of the false self, the small self, the ritualistic self—to the truth of what already is.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: The Way Forward</h3>
<p>The Way is not through ritual. It is through remembrance.</p>
<p>You remember who you are—not in church, not through law, not through sacrifice—but in the <strong>quiet conviction</strong> that what you imagine as true, becomes true.</p>
<p>This is the law, not written in books or scrolls, but written within.</p>
<p>As it is said in <strong>Jeremiah 31:33</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Old Covenant taught us how to act.<br />
The New Covenant teaches us how to <strong>be</strong>.</p>
