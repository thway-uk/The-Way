It is the operating power of awareness and self- perception, the cause of all that appears in your world.</div>

<p>“I AM is the self-definition of the absolute.” — Neville Goddard</p>

<h3>Genesis 1:26 — Man in God's Image</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness…" — <em>Genesis 1:26</em> </p></blockquote>
<p>Neville taught that “<a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>” in this verse is Elohim, a plural name representing the manifold aspects of imagination. <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Man is made in the image of God</a> — not as flesh, but as consciousness with the power to assume. To “<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">be made in the image</a> of God” means you are endowed with the ability to become what you assume yourself to be.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Exodus 3:14 — The Name of God Is “I AM”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>I AM</b> THAT <b>I AM</b>." — <em>Exodus 3:14 (KJV)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Moses asks for <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">God's name</a>, he is given the purest revelation of consciousness: <a href="/search/label/I%20AM">I AM</a>. This is not a title of a distant deity. Neville interpreted this as your own awareness of being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I AM is the only name of God.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Hebrew, the name God gives is <em>Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh</em>, which translates as “<b>I will be what I will be.</b>” The root verb <em>hayah</em> (הָיָה) means to be, to exist. The divine name is deeply connected to <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">YHWH</a> (יהוה), often translated as “The Existing One". "<i>I will be what I will be" </i>is an echo of "<i>bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh</i>" — scriptures <a href="/p/genesis-223-woman.html">definition of 'woman</a>'.</p><p>The phrase “<b><a href="/search/label/I%20AM">I AM THAT I AM</a></b>” is a double repetition that reveals a fundamental spiritual law often overlooked: <b><a href="/2025/05/the-law-of-identical-harvest-neville.html">the Law of Identical Harvest</a></b>. This law teaches that the state you declare and assume within yourself will return to you exactly as you embody it. By saying “I AM that I AM,” the Divine reveals that your self-concept and <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">identity are the seeds you plant</a> in the fertile ground of your imagination. What you consistently affirm about yourself, with feeling and conviction, will bear fruit in your external world. This mirrors Neville Goddard’s teaching that persistence in the assumption hardens into fact — you <b><a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">reap what you sow in consciousness</a></b>, identical to the identity you claim.</p>
<p>Neville viewed this not as a name for an external being, but as the <b>revelation of <i>your own</i> eternal identity </b>— pure awareness, divine being, and the creative source within.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Law of Assumption: Identity Precedes Experience</h3>
<p>Neville made it clear: assumption is the key to manifestation. You must <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">assume the feeling of the wish fulfill</a>ed — not hope, not wish, not strive — but live inwardly in the end result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. That assumption, though false, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying “I AM healthy” or “I AM successful” is not an affirmation — it is a creative act. Your world reshapes itself around your accepted state of being. Consciousness is the only reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Solomon’s Temple: A Symbol of Inner Structure</h3>
<p>Neville often spoke of <a href="/2025/05/building-i-am-temple-as-sacred-metaphor.html">Solomon’s Temple</a> as a metaphor for the human imagination — the place where God (I AM) dwells. The temple was not built by human hands but signifies the structure of awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Holy of Holies is the deepest self, the awareness of being — “I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outer courts represent states — assumptions you can enter and dwell in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To “<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-of-tents-cities-and.html">build the temple</a>” is to discipline your imagination and inhabit only the states you desire to externalise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Bible is a psychological drama. The characters represent states of consciousness.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>The Triune Nature of Man: Spirit, Soul, and Body</h3>
<p>Neville linked “I AM” with the threefold nature of our being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Spirit (I AM | <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Ask</a>):</strong> The divine consciousness within — the true self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soul (Imagination | <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Believe</a>):</strong> The creative centre where desires are conceived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Body (Manifestation | <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">Receive</a>):</strong> The physical expression of what is held in consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The “<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” is the unifying force. It moves thoughts into form, ideas into experience, and imagination into reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Jesus’ “I AM” Sayings: Consciousness in Action</h3>
<p><a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a>, according to Neville, represents your own wonderful human imagination. His<a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html"> “I AM”</a> statements are examples of assumed identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“I AM the light of the world” (John 8:12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM the bread of life” (John 6:35)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM the way…” (John 14:6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM the resurrection…” (John 11:25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Before Abraham was, I AM” (John 8:58)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Jesus</a> speaks not as a <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">man</a> but as the personification of awakened imagination — the inner voice that knows itself to be the operant power.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Jesus’ “I AM” Statements and the Divine Identity</h3>
<p>Neville taught that the Trinity symbolises the process of assumption — the movement from awareness, through imagination, into experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>God the Father — <em>“I AM”</em></strong><br />
The eternal awareness within you — pure being, unconditioned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM that I AM”</em> — <em>Exodus 3:14</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus the Son — <em>Imagination aligned with ‘I AM’</em></strong><br />
The <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">state you consciously assume</a> — your self-concept in harmony with inner knowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Holy Spirit — <em>The transformation that occurs</em></strong><br />
The unseen power that brings your imagined state into visible experience — the bridge between assumption and its expression.</p></li></ul>
<hr />
<h3>Resurrection: The Awakening to “I AM”</h3>
<p>Neville taught that the resurrection is not a historical event but a personal realisation: the moment you become aware that I AM is God and that you are its operative power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The resurrection is when man discovers he is God.”<br />
“Man awakens to the truth that imagination creates reality.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the rebirth — the rising out of ignorance into deliberate creation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Practice: Living From “I AM”</h3>
<p>Daily, you are using “I AM” — either ignorantly or wisely. Neville urges you to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and live from it. You must move from thinking of what you want to thinking from it.</p>
<p>Repeat:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“I AM chosen”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM peaceful”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM already it”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I AM the one I want to be”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not empty affirmations — they are acts of creation. You are defining yourself, and the world will reflect your definition.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion: “I AM” as the Divine Formula</h3>
<p>The phrase “I AM” is at the heart of Neville Goddard’s philosophy. It is the bridge between the human and the divine — the key to understanding your role as a creator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a>, if you would only believe it.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do not need to convince the outer world — only to accept inwardly that you already are the state you desire to express. The Law of Assumption tells us: persist in the assumption, and it will harden into fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Claim it. Feel it. Persist in it — and it shall be so.” — Neville Goddard</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“God is Imagination—the creative power within us all. Jesus represents this power in action, showing us that we can create and transform our lives by assuming the feeling of our desires already fulfilled. God isn’t external, but within.”</p></blockquote>
