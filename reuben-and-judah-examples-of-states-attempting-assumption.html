    <h1>Reuben and Judah: Examples of States Attempting Assumption</h1>
    <p>The stories of Reuben lying with his father’s concubine (Genesis 35:22) and <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">Judah’s union with Tamar </a>(Genesis 38) are more than moral lessons. They symbolise two different states of awareness engaging with the Law of Assumption — the process of shifting from the old self to the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">new imagined self</a>.</p>
<p>This is reflected in Genesis 2:24:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not about literal <a href="/2025/05/genesis-224-hidden-pattern-driving.html">marriage</a> but about leaving behind the old, inherited identity and uniting with the new inner self.</p>
<h3>Reuben: Clinging to the Old</h3>
<p>Reuben, the firstborn, represents the old self holding on to inherited ways. His act of lying with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, symbolises trying to claim identity through past habits rather than transformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine...” (Genesis 35:22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reuben refuses to leave the old self behind, attempting assumption without real change. Jacob later condemns him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.” (Genesis 49:4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows the futility of spiritual inheritance without inner transformation.</p>
<h3>Judah and Tamar: Toying with the Law of Assumption</h3>
<p>Judah, the fourth son, symbolises the mind <a href="/2025/04/tamah-judah-and-perez.html">beginning to toy with the Law of Assumption</a>. Tamar represents imagination — veiled, waiting, and ready to respond when called.</p>
<p>Judah hesitates, holding back his youngest son Shelah from Tamar out of fear of repeating old mistakes. This hesitation symbolises the mind’s reluctance to fully commit to the Law.</p>
<p>However, Judah’s small movement — his <a href="/2025/07/the-meaning-of-timnah-in-bible-and-its.html">journey to Timnah</a> (meaning “portion” or “measured lot”) — signals toying with a new state of being. It is enough to stir Tamar, who waits veiled at Enaim (“openings” or “<a href="/2025/04/wheels-within-wheels-symbolism-of-inner.html">eyes</a>”), the symbolic place where imagination is ready to meet the new assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She sat down at the entrance to Enaim...” — Genesis 38:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judah unwittingly gives Tamar his seal, cord, and staff — symbols of his “I AM” identity. This act causes conception, a new state beginning to form, though Judah does not yet fully understand it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand...” — Genesis 38:18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Tamar is found pregnant, Judah recognises the law at work, declaring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She is more righteous than I...” — Genesis 38:26</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The union of Judah and Tamar births Perez — meaning breakthrough — symbolising manifestation itself: a surprising and natural outcome of assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is how you have broken out!” — Genesis 38:29</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Two Attempts at Assumption</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reuben:</strong> Attempts identity through old patterns — no true transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Judah:</strong> Toys with a new assumption, awakening imagination (Tamar) and triggering breakthrough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The old self cannot enter the new by repeating the past. Transformation happens when imagination responds to the self’s new assumption.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Tamar as Imagination’s Response</h3>
<p>Tamar is the imagination patiently waiting and then responding to Judah’s hesitant assumption. Their story teaches that even a small movement toward a new identity can awaken imagination and create breakthrough.</p>
