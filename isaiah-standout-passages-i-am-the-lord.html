    <h1>Isaiah Standout Passages: I AM the Lord</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>“I AM the Lord, and There is None Else” </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I AM the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me.”— Isaiah 45:5</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage highlights the omnipresence and indivisibility of God, which Neville Goddard teaches as the creative power within each of us. When God says, "<a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">I AM the Lord</a>," it isn't an external declaration. <strong><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God's</a> creative presence, the "<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>," is within you.</strong> Neville emphasized that "I AM" is the central force that shapes all creation. To say “<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>” is to align with the divine creative power that is always present within your consciousness. It’s not about a distant, separate God; it’s about recognizing the power of imagination within yourself. <strong>There is no God outside of you.</strong> The "I AM" is not external but the very essence of your being.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>“I AM He That Blotteth Out Thy Transgressions”</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.”— Isaiah 43:25</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville often spoke about how imagination can transform and redeem us. This passage reminds us that the power to erase our limitations and mistakes lies within our own consciousness. Just as <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God</a>, the "<a href="/p/exodus-314-i-am.html">I AM</a>," blots out sins, <strong>we have the power within to erase negative beliefs and reshape our reality.</strong> When we change our thinking, we begin a new creation. Neville taught that there is no separation between the divine and the individual; the same creative power that blots out transgressions in the divine mind is the creative power of our imagination. In changing our thoughts and beliefs, we erase our old identity and create a new one aligned with our desires.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>“Behold, I Will Do a New Thing” </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.”— Isaiah 43:19</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse speaks to the transformative power of imagination, which Neville always linked to our connection with the divine creative force. <strong><a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">The "new thing" that springs forth is created through your imagination </a>- the seed in itself.</strong> As you consciously align with the "I AM" presence within you, you open the door to new possibilities. When you envision a new reality, you are creating it in the same way that <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God created</a> the world—through the power of imagination. The wilderness and desert symbolize the challenges you may face, but imagination is the force that brings water to the dry land, transforming your circumstances into something new and abundant.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>“It Is He That Sitteth Upon the Circle of the Earth” </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.”— Isaiah 40:22</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse speaks to the vastness and majesty of God's creative power, but Neville always pointed out that this <strong>creative power is within you.</strong> The "circle of the earth" symbolises the limitless nature of your imagination. Just as the heavens are stretched out by God, <strong>your imagination stretches out the heavens of your own reality</strong>. The "<a href="/2025/04/the-plagues-of-egypt-symbolic-guide.html">grasshoppers</a>" represent the small, limiting beliefs and thoughts that can hinder us, but Neville would remind us that <strong>we are not grasshoppers</strong>; we are the creators, endowed with the power to reshape our world through imagination. <strong>God’s power is within you, and through imagination, you can stretch the heavens and change your reality.</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>“Woe Unto Him That Striveth with His Maker” </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?”— Isaiah 45:9</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage speaks to the relationship between the creator (you) and the creative process. Neville often reminded us that we are not separate from God’s creative power; we are the very instrument of creation. To "strive with the Maker" is to resist or deny the power within us. When we refuse to acknowledge our creative power, we struggle against the flow of life. <strong>The “I AM” is your Maker, and it is within you.</strong> Neville consistently taught that to manifest effectively, we must surrender to the creative power within us, which is our true self. The clay cannot question the potter, for the <a href="/2025/07/formed-from-dust-serpent-and-potters.html">potter and the clay </a>are one in the act of creation.</p>
