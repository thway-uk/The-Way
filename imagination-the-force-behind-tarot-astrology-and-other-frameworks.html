    <h1>Imagination: The Force Behind Tarot, Astrology and Other Frameworks</h1>
    <p>Many of today’s spiritual practices—whether it's astrology, alchemy, Tarot, Buddhism, or even systems like witchcraft—are built on the fundamental truth that <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">imagination</a> shapes our reality. But over time, the core idea has been obscured. These practices, while diverse in their symbols and rituals, all point to the same underlying principle: <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> is the key to creating our life.</p>
<p><a href="/2025/06/only-neville-interpreted-bible-as-whole.html">Neville Goddard's </a>teachings brought this principle into sharp focus, stripping away the complexity. He didn’t rely on external rituals or systems; he emphasised the power within us through imagination and assumption. The law of assumption is not just a teaching of Neville’s—it is an ancient truth found across many spiritual traditions. Whether you look at astrology's cycles, alchemy's transformation, or even certain aspects of Buddhism, you’ll find echoes of this central idea: that our thoughts and imagination shape our experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in many modern spiritual systems, the simplicity of this truth has been obscured by complex rituals, symbols, and practices. While Neville’s work is rooted in his interpretation of the Bible, this foundational aspect has often been stripped away, leaving behind a diluted version, commonly found in influencer content on platforms like YouTube or TikTok. What was once a clear understanding of imagination as the creative force has become tangled in external systems that divert attention from the true power within us.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard’s brilliance was in returning to the simple truth: everything begins with the imagination. By assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled, we can change our reality. This core message is at the heart of all the great spiritual systems—if we only remember to look beyond the complexity and reclaim the simplicity.</p>
