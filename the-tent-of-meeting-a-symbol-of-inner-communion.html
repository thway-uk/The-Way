    <h1>The Tent of Meeting: A Symbol of Inner Communion</h1>
    <p>The Tent of Meeting, introduced in Exodus, was not just a physical structure—it was a symbol of conscious union with the divine. Here, Moses would "speak with the Lord face to face, as one speaks to a friend" (Exodus 33:11). In the language of Neville Goddard, this is the inner chamber of imagination—the sacred space where man communes with his I AM, the God within.</p>
<p>We’re told that “Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the ‘tent of meeting’” (Exodus 33:7). This physical separation signifies the spiritual withdrawal required for divine communion. It's the quiet, imaginal place where desires are impressed and visions are born. Just as Moses did not enter the tent empty-handed, we too bring our intentions, our inner conversations, and our focused states into this holy space.</p>
<p>The Tent of Meeting reminds us that God is not afar, but dwelling in the imaginal act, always ready to manifest through the one who dares to believe in the unseen.</p>
