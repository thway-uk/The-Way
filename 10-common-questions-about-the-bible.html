<h1>10 Common Questions About the Bible</h1>
<p>Many people turn to the Bible with questions — both about its content and its relevance. But the way we interpret it determines the answers we receive. For those familiar with the teachings of Neville Goddard, the Bible isn't a historical document, but a <strong>psychological drama</strong> unfolding within us. It reveals <strong>the law of <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">consciousness</a></strong> — showing how assumption, belief, and inner vision create reality.</p><p>Here are 10 of the most-asked Bible questions, reframed through the deeper meaning Neville believed the Bible holds.</p><hr /><h3>1. <strong>Are dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible?</strong></h3><p>The Bible doesn't directly mention dinosaurs, but that doesn’t mean it’s silent about the <strong>forces of nature</strong> or ancient memories buried in the <strong>subconscious</strong>. Creatures like Leviathan and Behemoth (see Job 40–41) are poetic representations of <strong>untamed aspects of the self</strong> — the "<a href="/search/label/Beast%20Series"><b>beast mind</b></a>" over which <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">man must gain dominion</a>. In Neville’s view, everything in the Bible symbolises something <strong>within</strong>. The monstrous is simply the misunderstood part of ourselves that must be integrated and ruled.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox...”<br />
<em>Job 40:15</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>2. <strong>Was Jesus really born on December 25th?</strong></h3><p>Historically speaking, no. But from the standpoint of spiritual symbolism, the date doesn't matter. What matters is the <strong>birth of awareness</strong>. Neville taught that <strong><a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus represents your awakened imagination</a></strong> — the divine creative power in man. The true birth of Jesus is that moment you accept "I AM" as the only reality, and begin to live by assumption.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...”<br />
<em>Isaiah 9:6</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>3. <strong>What is the shortest verse in the Bible?</strong></h3><p>“Jesus wept.” (John 11:35)</p><p>Neville would say this verse shows the divine power of awareness <strong>entering into human sorrow</strong> — allowing itself to feel loss, only to transform it. Jesus weeping is imagination <strong><a href="/2025/04/jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">mourning the death of its own ideal</a></strong>, before resurrecting it. It’s a reminder that even when we feel broken, consciousness still holds the key to life.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Jesus wept.”<br />
<em>John 11:35</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>4. <strong>Is the Bible still the best-selling book of all time?</strong></h3><p>Yes, and rightly so — because it's <strong>the manual of the soul</strong>. Whether or not people interpret it spiritually, it continues to speak. Neville reminded us that beneath the literal words lies a <strong>map of human awakening</strong>. It’s not a book about ancient Israel — it’s about <strong>you</strong>, the reader, and <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">your power to imagine and become.</a></p><hr /><h3>5. <strong>What language was the Bible originally written in?</strong></h3><p>The Old Testament was mainly written in Hebrew, the New in Greek. Neville often pointed out that <strong><a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew letters themselves carry symbolic meaning</a></strong>. For instance, <a href="/2025/05/law-of-assumption-creative-pattern.html">David is spelled Dalet–Vav–Dalet</a>: doorway–hook–doorway. It’s not just a name — it’s a code. Language in the Bible is layered with metaphor, revealing <strong>states of consciousness</strong> when understood inwardly.</p><hr /><h3>6. <strong>Who wrote the Bible?</strong></h3><p>Many authors, over centuries. But Neville taught that the real author was <strong><a href="/p/elohim-god.html">consciousness itself</a></strong>. The men who wrote the text were inspired by spiritual insight — by dreams, visions, and inner voices. The question becomes not "who wrote it?" but <strong>"how am I meant to read it?"</strong> When seen as your own biography in symbolic form, it becomes personal and alive.</p><hr /><h3>7. <strong>Why are there so many Bible translations?</strong></h3><p>Because the <strong>inner meaning</strong> of the text is eternal, while words shift with culture. Neville was less concerned with the exact wording and more with the <strong>revelation it stirs</strong> in the reader. A <a href="/2025/04/the-bible-speaks-in-symbols-evidence.html">modern translation might help you see the truth that was always there </a>— that you are the operant power.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The letter kills, but the spirit gives life.”<br />
<em>2 Corinthians 3:6</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>8. <strong>How many books are in the Bible?</strong></h3><p>The standard Protestant Bible has 66 books. But what matters more than number is the <strong>narrative arc</strong>: from creation in Genesis to revelation in Revelation. Neville saw the Bible as telling <strong>one story</strong> — the fall and redemption of awareness, the journey from forgetting who you are to remembering: <strong><a href="/2025/04/the-father-and-i-are-one.html">I and my Father are one</a>.</strong></p><hr /><h3>9. <strong>What is the last book of the Bible?</strong></h3><p><a href="/search/label/Revelation%20Series">Revelation</a>. But it's not about the end of the world — it's about the <strong>unveiling</strong> of your true identity. The Greek word is <em>apokalypsis</em>, meaning disclosure or revealing. Neville often quoted Revelation as the book of <strong>inner transformation</strong>, not outer catastrophe. It is the moment you see <strong>yourself</strong> as the power that creates.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.”<br />
<em>Revelation 22:7</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3>10. <strong>What is the first book of the Bible?</strong></h3><p>Genesis. But again — not a history book. It begins not with a bang or a big bang, but with <strong>imagination imagining</strong>. <a href="/p/genesis-1-creation.html">“In the beginning God created...”</a> is the starting point of all things — and in Neville’s view, that God is <strong>your own wonderful human imagination</strong>. It's particularly important to understand the function of the word Elohim as <a href="/p/elohim-god.html">God in the Bible</a>, because the narrative is based upon its structure.</p><blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”<br />
<em>Genesis 1:1</em></p>
</blockquote><hr /><p>If you're willing to go beyond the surface, the Bible becomes a treasure trove of insight. As Neville said, it’s <strong>your autobiography</strong>, written in symbolic form. Every character is a state. Every story is your own journey from unawareness to awakening.</p><p>You are the ark. You are the temple.<br />
And when you finally assume the highest truth — “I AM” —<br />
You become the fulfilment of the whole book.</p>
