    <h1>David and Jesus: What They Symbolise in You</h1>
    <p>If you're new to Neville Goddard's teachings, it helps to understand that the Bible isn't just a historical account—it's a symbolic story of <em>you</em>. Every character represents a state of consciousness or something unfolding within your own mind.</p>
<p>In this view, <strong>David</strong> symbolises the <em>fulfilled desire</em>. He’s the state you enter when what you’ve imagined begins to show itself in the world. David is called “the beloved,” not because of outward status, but because he reflects the inner work of imagination taking form.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus</strong>, in Neville’s interpretation, represents your <em>own imagination</em>—the God within you. He is the awareness of “I Am,” the truth that everything you experience starts within. When you realise this, you begin to take full responsibility for your world, knowing it is shaped by your inner states.</p>
<p>Neville often said, “Jesus is the Lord, and David is His Son.” It sounds mysterious at first, but it’s beautifully simple: your imagination (Jesus) creates your outer world (David). And when your desire comes to life, you discover that what you brought into being is calling <em>you</em> Father.</p>
<p>This is the journey from imagining to experiencing. You are both the Creator and the one who sees the creation. The Bible, through these symbols, is telling the story of your own spiritual awakening.</p>
