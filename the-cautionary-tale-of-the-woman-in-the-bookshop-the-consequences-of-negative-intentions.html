<h1>The Cautionary Tale of the Woman in the Bookshop: The Consequences of Negative Intentions</h1>
<p></p>In the world of manifestation and the law of assumption, our intentions shape the life we live. Neville Goddard often spoke about how our thoughts and inner beliefs form the reality we experience, and sometimes, these realities are the result of our negative assumptions. One particular story he shared serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of being mindful of our intentions.<p>Neville told the story of a woman who worked in a bookshop. She had a habit of marking up books to a higher price whenever a customer showed interest in them. The intention behind her actions was clear: she was taking advantage of the customers’ curiosity, profiting from their attention. It was a seemingly small action, but one rooted in a mindset of scarcity and selfishness. She was manipulating others for her own gain, without any regard for fairness or honesty.</p><p>This might seem like a harmless act—perhaps even something we could rationalise as part of the hustle. However, Neville used this story to illustrate the deeper consequences of harboring negative intentions. The woman was operating from a state of lack, exploiting others, and her actions were out of harmony with the natural flow of abundance and love that governs the universe. It’s not just that she was marking up the prices; it was that she was marking them up with a mindset that would ultimately bring her nothing but emptiness.</p><p>As the story goes, this woman eventually died, and what’s most striking is that nobody knew who she was. Her life, marked by selfish actions and exploitation, left no lasting legacy. No one remembered her, no one mourned her, and her time in the world passed unnoticed. In the end, her harmful actions didn’t just impact others; they also left her without significance in the grander scope of life.</p><p>Neville’s message here is clear: the law of assumption works in every area of our lives, and our inner state governs the experiences we manifest. Negative assumptions, harmful intentions, and selfish actions don’t just lead to negative material results—they also lead to a life devoid of meaning and connection. The universe, in its infinite wisdom, reflects back to us the nature of our thoughts and intentions. When we act from a place of scarcity, exploitation, or selfishness, we invite those same qualities back into our lives.</p><p>This lesson is further emphasised by a deeply personal story Neville shared about his own childhood. He spoke about a teacher who, during his school years, abused him both physically and sexually. This teacher’s actions left a profound impact on Neville, but Neville later observed that the teacher's life ended tragically—he took his own life. Neville interpreted this as an illustration of how the destructive thoughts and actions we carry—especially those rooted in pain and negative assumptions—can manifest in our lives in ways that ultimately lead to our own undoing. The teacher’s abuse, driven by his own inner darkness, manifested in a tragic and final consequence.</p><p>Neville used this painful experience to show the power of the subconscious mind. The thoughts and feelings we hold, especially the negative ones, can have life-shaping effects. In the case of his teacher, unresolved pain and harmful assumptions ultimately led to self-destruction. This story, although tragic, was used by Neville as a reminder of how important it is to address our inner states and negative assumptions before they lead to destructive consequences.</p><p>Both of these stories—of the woman in the bookshop and Neville’s teacher—are examples of the <strong>unrefined aspects of the subconscious mind</strong>. Neville often described these negative tendencies as the subconscious mind not being fully aligned with love, abundance, or spiritual truths. It is the part of the mind that operates on assumptions of lack, fear, and selfishness, which leads to harmful actions and negative consequences. These stories are vivid illustrations of how unrefined thoughts, unchecked desires, and negative beliefs shape destructive realities.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Woman in the Bookshop</strong> – Her actions, driven by greed and manipulation (marking up the books when customers showed interest), come from a mindset of scarcity and exploitation. She was using others to further her own gain, showing a lack of compassion and fairness. This is an example of the unrefined subconscious mind at work: a mindset that operates on self-interest and material gain at the expense of others. Ultimately, this mindset left her without a legacy and contributed to her passing into obscurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neville's Teacher</strong> – The teacher who abused Neville and later took his own life is another example of the destructive effects of the unrefined subconscious mind. This teacher’s actions were driven by deep inner darkness, pain, and unresolved negative assumptions. Instead of transforming his inner turmoil, he acted out of repressed negativity, which ultimately led to his self-destruction. In Neville’s view, this also reflects the workings of the unrefined subconscious mind: a mind that is dominated by unresolved fears, desires, and harmful beliefs that shape destructive outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Both of these stories illustrate how the subconscious mind, when unrefined and filled with negative assumptions, operates in ways that bring harm. The unrefined subconscious is not inherently evil; rather, it’s the result of negative, unexamined beliefs and assumptions that influence a person's actions. The consequence of living from this unrefined state is often a life marked by negativity, pain, and, in the worst cases, self-destruction.</p><p>Once you learn how to manifest and imagine your best life, you realise there is no need to resort to actions like the woman’s or harbor the kind of inner negativity Neville's teacher embodied. When you understand the power of imagination and how your thoughts shape reality, you begin to see that you don’t need to manipulate or take advantage of others to create success. There is an infinite abundance available to all, and your ability to align with this abundance means you can attract everything you desire without harming others or living in a state of lack. When you live from a mindset of love, fairness, and self-worth, your reality will mirror that.</p><p>So, what can we learn from these cautionary tales?</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Our intentions matter</strong> – The quality of our thoughts, feelings, and actions determines the quality of our lives. If we are motivated by selfishness or manipulation, those qualities will eventually manifest in our experiences, often in ways we don’t expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What we give, we receive</strong> – The law of assumption is a mirror. If we approach the world with generosity, fairness, and kindness, those qualities are reflected back to us. If we approach the world with exploitation, scarcity, or deceit, the world will reflect those qualities in turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legacy is more than what we leave behind</strong> – The woman in the story left behind no trace of who she was because she lived her life in a way that lacked meaning and depth. The true legacy we create is not about material success or recognition, but about the impact we have on others, the love we share, and the kindness we show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformation starts from within</strong> – We have the power to change our lives by shifting our inner state. If we find ourselves acting from a negative or harmful place, it’s not too late to change. By shifting our assumptions and embracing a mindset of love, abundance, and generosity, we can create a completely different reality.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The stories of both the woman in the bookshop and Neville's teacher serve as powerful reminders that every action, no matter how small, has consequences—both for us and for those around us. In the end, it’s not the material possessions or fleeting advantages we gain that define us, but the integrity of our intentions, the way we treat others, and the legacy of love and kindness we leave behind.</p><p>As Neville Goddard always taught, the law of assumption doesn’t discriminate; it works for good or ill, depending on the nature of your thoughts and intentions. Let these stories inspire you to cultivate a consciousness of love, fairness, and abundance, so that you may manifest not only the life you desire but also a life of true significance and meaning.</p>
