    <h1>Tree and Wood Symbolism</h1>
    <h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLtTdcNEcppqiol5CF9nPoEqCfdueWnCi0_zD-qjoxE116pZ7mFdAR42dtP3ZXYD8r_TnxeEPziT8aLfExlRsLxrcp_RFKxdCHX3Mzg-gnMBd3U8EZEWPLHHzO2eGyZtdTI7nvimmdlHIg4rHkIlhKnsRGcuC4iGCujW-EStXEMkGLe4-lbBw-n-XwDSZR/s800/tree-of-life-brain.jpeg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Tree or Life Brain The Way" border="0" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLtTdcNEcppqiol5CF9nPoEqCfdueWnCi0_zD-qjoxE116pZ7mFdAR42dtP3ZXYD8r_TnxeEPziT8aLfExlRsLxrcp_RFKxdCHX3Mzg-gnMBd3U8EZEWPLHHzO2eGyZtdTI7nvimmdlHIg4rHkIlhKnsRGcuC4iGCujW-EStXEMkGLe4-lbBw-n-XwDSZR/w167-h200/tree-of-life-brain.jpeg" width="127" /></a></div>The Garden of Eden: Two Trees, Two States</h3><p>In the <a href="/2025/05/eden-within-two-trees-four-rivers-and.html">Garden of Eden</a>, two central <a href="/2025/05/the-garden-within-trees-rivers-and-flow.html">trees</a> are named:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tree of Life:</strong> Representing unity, imagination, and divine potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil:</strong> Representing duality, judgement, and the ego's tendency to separate.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To eat from the latter is to fall into divided thinking—to become trapped in the realm of appearances, cause and effect, right and wrong. For Neville, this marks the beginning of conscious separation from creative power. Redemption comes when one returns to the <a href="/2025/05/the-garden-within-trees-rivers-and-flow.html">Tree of Life</a>, which is the acceptance of imagination as the sole creative force.</p><p>Neville beautifully evokes William Blake’s insight on this inner spiritual process:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Blake saw it so clearly, and said:<br />
‘The gods of the earth and sea sought through nature to find this tree, but their search was all in vain; there grows one in the human brain.’”<br />
Neville adds, “That is where the tree of life begins to bloom again.”</p>
</blockquote><p>This profound image reveals that the true “<a href="/2025/05/the-garden-within-trees-rivers-and-flow.html">trees” of life</a> are not merely external objects but the inner growth of consciousness itself—the imagination flowering within the mind.</p><hr /><h3>Tree Symbolism: Growth and Manifestation</h3><p>In Neville's understanding, trees symbolise the unfolding of ideas and the manifestation of states. Like a tree that grows from a seed, our desires and assumptions begin invisibly within and gradually become visible in our external world.</p><h3>The Tree of Life</h3><p>The Tree of Life is a recurring symbol of imagination. It signifies the divine seed that nourishes our desires into tangible experience. Just as a tree gives fruit, shade, and shelter, so does our imagination bring about fulfilment, protection, and sustenance. It is a symbol of limitless possibility and harmonious creation.</p><h3>The Good Tree and the Bad Tree</h3><p>In Matthew 7:17-20, Jesus teaches that a good tree produces good fruit, while a bad tree produces bad fruit. Neville interprets this as the distinction between constructive and destructive states of mind. The "good tree" symbolises a consciousness rooted in positive, life-giving assumptions. Conversely, the "bad tree" reflects fear, doubt, and limitation. The fruit reveals the inner nature of the tree—or, psychologically, the state one inhabits.</p><h3>Wood: The Physical Expression of Belief</h3><p>Wood, in Neville's interpretation, symbolises the physical expression of consciousness. It is the material that forms once a belief or assumption has taken root.</p><h3>The Cross and the Wood of Transformation</h3><p>Neville frequently presents the <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">cross</a> as a symbol of mental fixation. It is the point where imagination becomes nailed or fixed to an idea. The wood of the cross symbolises the earthly plane, where spiritual identity is tested and transformed. The <a href="/2025/04/sword-nail-skull-and-cross-power-and.html">crucifixion</a>, then, is not about pain, but about the death of the old self and the birth of a new assumption.</p><h3>The World as Wood</h3><p>Just as trees produce wood, so our minds produce form. The wood used in buildings or furniture represents the external world as the finished result of internal assumptions. The raw tree becomes shaped wood; likewise, the raw idea becomes shaped experience.</p><h3>The Fig Tree: Imagination Must Bear Fruit</h3><p>When Jesus <a href="/2025/05/fig-trees-and-false-appearances-eden.html">curses the barren fig tree</a> (Mark 11:12-14; Matthew 21:18-22), Neville interprets this as a warning against unproductive imagination. A tree without fruit symbolises a state of consciousness that holds desire but does not act or assume. In psychological terms, it speaks to the necessity of fruitful imagination—active belief that gives birth to experience.</p><hr /><h3>Jesus the Carpenter: Builder of Consciousness</h3><p>Jesus being a carpenter is no trivial detail. In Neville's framework, it reveals his role as the shaper of states. A carpenter works with wood, just as the imagination works with raw thought to produce lived experience.</p><blockquote>
<p>"Is not this the woodworker, the son of Mary...?" (Mark 6:3, BBE)</p>
</blockquote><p>The tools of the carpenter—hammer, chisel, saw—mirror the mental tools of focused intention, disciplined imagination, and emotional conviction. Jesus, symbolising the divine "I AM," is the builder of identity. Just as a carpenter fashions furniture, so the Christ-consciousness fashions reality from the substance of thought.</p><p>His crucifixion on a wooden cross unites these symbols: the carpenter is crucified upon his own material, suggesting that the life we construct becomes the very place where we are tested, transformed, and ultimately resurrected.</p><hr /><h3>The Crown of Thorns: Mental Suffering and Redemption</h3><p>The crown of thorns placed on Jesus’ head carries its own wooden symbolism. In Neville’s reading, thorns represent negative thoughts and limiting beliefs. They are the painful consequences of ego-driven separation and false assumptions.</p><p>Made from a tree, the crown of thorns symbolises the suffering caused by erroneous thinking. And yet, this very crown is worn by the Christ-self, showing that redemption lies in transforming thought. When we overcome our inner thorns, we exchange them for a crown of glory—the awakened awareness of our creative power.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: From Tree to Truth</h3><p>Through Neville Goddard’s interpretations, trees and wood are never just botanical or historical details. They are metaphors for the process of internal transformation, from seed to manifestation, from raw idea to fixed form.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Trees symbolise the states we grow into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood represents the material formed from belief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cross is the moment belief becomes immovable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carpenter is the imagination shaping the soul's reality.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All of these symbols point back to the same truth: Imagination creates reality. The tree in Eden, the wood of the cross, the fig tree, the carpenter’s tools—each reveals the same message from a different angle: the outer world is the fruit of inner assumption.</p><p>To understand this is to return to the Tree of Life, and to live once again by the creative power that was always yours.</p>
