    <h1>Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh: The Song of Solomon and the Gifts of Assumption</h1>
    <p>When the wise men came to Jesus, they brought gifts that echoed deep poetic symbolism: <strong>gold, frankincense, and myrrh</strong>. These were not arbitrary tributes, but richly symbolic offerings that find their counterparts in the <strong>Song of Solomon</strong>—that fragrant book of divine longing and inner union.</p><h3>The Song of Solomon’s Perfumed Column</h3><p>In <em>Song of Solomon 3:6</em>, we read:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke,<br />
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<br />
with all the merchant’s finest powders?”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This is the soul rising through trial and assumption, perfumed with the very same symbols later brought to the Christ child. These aren't just offerings; they are poetic recognitions of the sacred inner transformation.</p><p>Later, <strong>gold</strong> appears in radiant description:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“His head is as the most fine gold,<br />
his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.”</em><br />
— <em>Song of Solomon 5:11</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The soul that has risen from the wilderness of doubt and separation now beholds the beauty of divine identity.</p><hr /><h3>The Symbolism of Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh</h3><p>Each element—<strong>myrrh, frankincense, gold</strong>—represents not only love but <strong>conscious realisation</strong>. In Neville Goddard’s <em>Law of Assumption</em>, these gifts symbolise the inner states of awakening to divine identity:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gold</strong>: Value and kingship — recognising your assumed identity as powerful and worthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frankincense</strong>: Sacred presence — acknowledging imagination as holy ground</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Myrrh</strong>: Transformation — the death of the old self and preservation of the new</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These are not merely external gestures. They are internal acknowledgements of who you now dare to be.</p><hr /><h3>The Magi: Aspects of Mind Manifesting the New Self</h3><p>The <strong>three wise men</strong> are far more than historical visitors—they are symbolic aspects of the <strong>mind</strong> collaborating in the act of manifestation:</p><h4>The Power of Three</h4><p>The number <strong>three</strong> signifies the harmony of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><b>Spirit </b>(I am)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Soul</b> (imagination)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Body </b>(manifestation)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All essential faculties working in unison to <strong>birth your new identity</strong>.</p><table>

</table><p>Together, the Magi represent the <strong>combined faculties of wisdom, reverence, and transformation</strong>—the internal powers that bring your imagined reality into being.</p><hr /><h3>Gifts as Manifestations of Inner Assumption</h3><p>The gifts they bring are <strong>mental and spiritual offerings</strong> to the “new Christ”—the <strong>new assumed state of being</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gold</strong> acknowledges the <em>worth and sovereignty</em> of your imagined self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frankincense</strong> honours <em>imagination</em> as sacred and divine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Myrrh</strong> marks the <em>death of old limitations</em> and the <em>birth of transformation</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>This perfectly reflects the <em>Law of Assumption</em>: the gifts symbolise what we choose to manifest through <strong>conscious imagination</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>Why Only Matthew Records the Magi</h3><p>The Magi appear <strong>only in the Gospel of Matthew</strong>—and that is no accident.</p><p>Appropriately, the name <strong>Matthew</strong> comes from the Hebrew <strong>Matityahu</strong>, meaning <em>“Gift of Yahweh”</em>—a divine gift. It encapsulates the beginning of conscious awakening: the sacred moment when <strong>faith is first stirred within</strong>, and <strong>imagination is received as holy</strong>.</p><p>Just as Abraham left his home without knowing his destination, and Matthew left his tax booth at Jesus’ call, so the soul begins its new identity here. The Magi come from the <strong>East</strong>, symbolising the <strong>dawn of new light</strong> and <strong>inner wisdom</strong>—faculties responding to the birth of your new self-conception.</p><hr /><h3>The Sacred Moment of Assumption</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king,<br />
behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,<br />
saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?<br />
for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.”</em><br />
— <em>Matthew 2:1–2</em></p>
</blockquote><p>This moment is the <strong>sacred inner movement</strong>: your soul sees the sign—the star—and dares to assume something divine is being born <strong>within</strong>.</p><p>And once you assume it, the gifts will come.<br />
<strong>Always.</strong></p>
