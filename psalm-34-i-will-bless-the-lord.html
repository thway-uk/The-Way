    <h1>Psalm 34: I Will Bless the Lord</h1>
    <p>Psalm 34 is often read as a comforting promise of God's goodness and protection. However, when viewed through the teachings of Neville Goddard, it becomes allegory for the journey of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>, imagination, and manifestation. Neville taught that God is your own wonderful human imagination. To "bless the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a>" and "seek Him" is to recognise and live from the imagining power within. Let us walk verse by verse through this Psalm, interpreting its poetry as a guide to inner transformation.</p><blockquote>
<p>I will be blessing the Lord at all times;<br />
His praise will be ever in my mouth.</p>
</blockquote><p>To bless the Lord is to stay conscious of your <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AMness</a>. Praise continually being in the mouth symbolises the constant discipline of mental assumption. You must speak and feel from the state you desire to express. This is prayer in Neville's terms—assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled.</p><blockquote>
<p>My soul will say great things of the Lord:<br />
The poor in spirit will have knowledge of it and be glad.</p>
</blockquote><p>The soul represents the feminine hidden heart of the mind. Its "boast" is the inner conviction that <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a> is the only power. The humble—your obedient inner faculties—rejoice when the conscious mind turns back to the truth of being.</p><blockquote>
<p>Give praise to the Lord with me;<br />
Let us make His name great together.</p>
</blockquote><p>To magnify the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> is to increase awareness of your true self, the <a href="/2025/04/the-symbolism-and-references-to-i-am-in.html">I AM</a>. To exalt His name is to raise your assumption to the highest level—to dwell not just on what you want, but from it.</p><blockquote>
<p>I was searching for the Lord, and He gave ear to my voice,<br />
And made me free from all my fears.</p>
</blockquote><p>Seeking the <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a> is turning inward. You direct attention away from fear and onto your assumption. In doing so, you are "heard"—your assumption is accepted by the subconscious, and you are delivered.</p><blockquote>
<p>Let your eyes be turned to Him and you will have light,<br />
And your faces will not be put to shame.</p>
</blockquote><p>Turning inward to I AM brings illumination. Shame only exists when we wrongly identify with limitation. When we recognise the divine within, we are lit from within and fearless.</p><blockquote>
<p>This poor man's cry came before the Lord,<br />
And He gave him salvation from all his troubles.</p>
</blockquote><p>The "poor man" symbolises any state of lack. The "cry" is a heartfelt desire. When assumed properly, the desire is received by the deeper self and results in transformation.</p><blockquote>
<p>The angel of the Lord is ever watching over those who have fear of Him,<br />
To keep them safe.</p>
</blockquote><p>The angel is divine law in action. To fear the Lord is to revere your own creative power. When you live with that reverence, you are protected by the law of consciousness.</p><blockquote>
<p>By experience you will see that the Lord is good;<br />
Happy is the man who has faith in Him.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is the invitation to test the law—assume the state and see its result. "Taste and see" means experience it for yourself. Trust in imagination always yields blessing.</p><blockquote>
<p>Keep your fear of the Lord, all you His saints;<br />
For those who do so will have no need of anything.</p>
</blockquote><p>Reverence for the inner I AM eliminates lack. To "fear" in this context is to honour and stay aware of your own imaginative power.</p><blockquote>
<p>The young lions are in need and have no food;<br />
But those who are looking to the Lord will have every good thing.</p>
</blockquote><p>Even strong, instinctive forces fail without inner awareness. True fulfilment comes only from seeking the inner Lord—your imagination.</p><blockquote>
<p>Come, children, give attention to me;<br />
I will be your teacher in the fear of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Children" are undeveloped faculties. The Psalm invites these aspects of consciousness to be trained in reverence for the inner divine law.</p><blockquote>
<p>What man has a love of life,<br />
And a desire that his days may be long and good?<br />
Keep your tongue from evil,<br />
And your lips from words of deceit.<br />
Be turned from evil, and do good;<br />
Make a search for peace, desiring it with all your heart.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is mental diet. Speak no deceit means imagine no contradiction to your desire. Evil is simply missing the mark—assuming wrongly. Do good: assume rightly.</p><blockquote>
<p>The eyes of the Lord are on the upright,<br />
And His ears are open to their cry.</p>
</blockquote><p>God’s “eyes” and “ears” symbolise awareness and receptivity. The subconscious receives the cry (impression) of the right assumption.</p><blockquote>
<p>The face of the Lord is against those who do evil,<br />
To take away the memory of them from the earth.</p>
</blockquote><p>States that contradict the law of assumption will fade. The "face" of the Lord—true awareness—cannot sustain falsehood.</p><blockquote>
<p>The cry of the upright comes before the Lord,<br />
And He takes them out of all their troubles.<br />
The Lord is near the broken-hearted;<br />
He is the saviour of those whose spirits are crushed down.</p>
</blockquote><p>The "broken heart" is the open heart, the surrendered mind. The Lord (I AM) is closest when you’re vulnerable, ready to let go of resistance.</p><blockquote>
<p>Great are the troubles of the upright:<br />
But the Lord takes him safely out of them all.</p>
</blockquote><p>Even when imagining rightly, external tests may arise—but persistence always leads to deliverance.</p><blockquote>
<p>He keeps all his bones:<br />
Not one of them is broken.</p>
</blockquote><p>Bones represent structure and spiritual truth. The person grounded in the I AM holds firm—truth remains unbroken.</p><blockquote>
<p>Evil will put an end to the sinner,<br />
And those who are haters of righteousness will come to destruction.<br />
The Lord will be the saviour of the souls of His servants,<br />
And no one who has faith in Him will be put to shame.</p></blockquote><div><p></p></div>
