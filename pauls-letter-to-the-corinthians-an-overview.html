    <h1>Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians: An Overview</h1>
    <p>Paul’s letter to the Corinthians is a call to <strong>spiritual awakening</strong>—a journey from <strong>external, reason-based consciousness</strong> to recognising the power of <strong>imagination</strong> as the creative force in our lives. The Corinthians represent the <strong>immature state of consciousness</strong>, still caught in the outer world and unable to realise their own creative power.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Paul: The Voice of Awakening</strong></h3>
<p>Paul symbolises the <strong>awakened state of consciousness</strong>, the one who understands that <strong>imagination</strong> is God. He embodies the transition from <strong>Saul (the old man)</strong> to <strong>Paul (the new man)</strong>, symbolising the shift from external power to the inner creative power of the mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Corinthians: Immature Consciousness</strong></h3>
<p>The Corinthians are <strong>babes in Christ</strong>, representing those who have heard the truth but still live in the <strong>natural state of consciousness</strong>, where they rely on outer appearances and sensory evidence. Their journey mirrors ours when we first encounter the idea of manifestation, still struggling to move beyond the physical world.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Spiritual Maturity: Moving Within</strong></h3>
<p>Paul urges the Corinthians to <strong>grow in understanding</strong>—to move beyond the <strong>external world</strong> and realise that the <strong>power to create</strong> lies within. In Neville’s terms, this is the shift from relying on the senses to creating from <strong>imagination</strong>. We are called to mature spiritually by recognising <strong>imagination</strong> as the true creative force.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Cross: Fixing the Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Paul says the <strong>cross</strong> is foolishness to the natural man (1 Corinthians 1:18). <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">Foolishness equates to sin</a> — to not imagining lovingly. The cross (<i>or mark, or</i><i> target</i>) refers to <strong>fixing an assumption</strong> in imagination and holding it there despite external evidence. The <strong>cross</strong> is the <strong>creative act</strong>—the moment we <strong>nail ourselves</strong> to the desired state in imagination. God put a <a href="/2025/07/cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">mark on Cain explicitly for this transformation.</a></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Natural Man vs. The Spiritual Man</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>natural man</strong> is the one who lives by the senses, the one who cannot understand the <strong>things of the Spirit</strong>. In Neville’s framework, this is the person who believes in the <strong>reality of the external world</strong>. The <strong>spiritual man</strong> knows that <strong>imagination</strong> is the source of all creation and shapes reality from within.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Imagination as the Creator</strong></h3>
<p>Paul’s letter is a reminder that we must move beyond the <strong>natural man</strong> and embrace the <strong>spiritual man</strong>—the realisation that <strong>imagination is God</strong>. By <strong>asssuming</strong> the state of our wish fulfilled, we step into our creative power, leaving behind the external world’s limitations.</p>
