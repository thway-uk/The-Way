    <h1>Love: A Straightforward Guide from the Bible and Neville Goddard</h1>
    <p>Love is at the heart of both Scripture and Neville Goddard’s teachings. But where the Bible often presents love as a divine command or virtue, Neville goes deeper—revealing love as a <em>state of consciousness</em> that you assume, feel, and thereby bring to life through imagination. This guide explores how love, as both biblical principle and creative power, becomes transformational when practised through the Law of Assumption.</p><hr /><h3><strong>1. Biblical Foundations of Love</strong></h3><p>The Bible uses several Greek words for love, but the most spiritually loaded is <strong>agapē</strong>—unconditional, selfless love. Traditionally, this love flows from God and is something we are commanded to embody.</p><h4>1.1 Love as Divine Command</h4><p><strong>Deuteronomy 6:5</strong><br />
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.”<br />
This verse calls for wholehearted devotion, but Neville would frame it not as an obligation but as a state to be <em>assumed</em>. To love God in Neville’s terms is to turn your awareness inward—towards your own imagination, the source of creation.</p><h4>1.2 Love as God’s Nature</h4><p><strong>1 John 4:7–8</strong><br />
“Love is from God… God is love.”<br />
To Neville, <em>God is your own wonderful human imagination</em>. So when the Bible says “God is love,” we might read it as “Imagination is love”—creative, boundless, and self-generating.</p><h4>1.3 Love in Action</h4><p><strong>1 Corinthians 13:1–3</strong><br />
“Without love, I am a clanging cymbal.”<br />
This reminds us that external action without inner feeling is hollow. Neville’s Law of Assumption teaches the reverse: only <em>inner feeling</em> can generate meaningful outer action.</p><h4>1.4 Love as Sacrifice</h4><p><strong>Romans 5:8</strong><br />
“Christ died for us.”<br />
Neville interprets Christ as the patterned, awakened imagination. The ‘death’ here can be seen symbolically: the surrender of ego, of past assumptions, in order to rise into a new loving state.</p><hr /><h3><strong>2. Neville Goddard’s View of Love</strong></h3><p>In Neville’s world, love is not an obligation but a <em>creative stance</em>. It's a vibration you deliberately assume within, knowing it must externalise.</p><h4>2.1 Love as a State of Consciousness</h4><p>“<strong>Feeling is the secret.</strong>”<br />
—<em>Feeling Is the Secret</em><br />
Love is not a reaction but a creative <em>assumption</em>. If you feel unloved and dwell in that, life reflects it. If you feel loved—even without evidence—life bends to fulfil that feeling.</p><p>This echoes the inner call found in <strong>Song of Solomon 2:10</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.”</em><br />
The beloved is invited to rise into a new state—the winter is past, the inner climate has shifted. This is the very nature of assuming love.</p>
</blockquote><h4>2.2 Love as Creative Force</h4><p>“<strong>Imagination creates reality.</strong>”<br />
—<em>The Power of Awareness</em><br />
The source of love isn’t another person—it’s <em>you</em>, imagining that you <em>are</em> loved, that you <em>are</em> loving, and letting that self-concept shape every interaction.</p><h4>2.3 Love and the Law of Assumption</h4><p>To experience love, Neville says to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume</strong> the state of being loved or loving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dwell</strong> in that inner conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Live</strong> from that reality, not toward it.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This mirrors <strong>Song of Solomon 3:1–4</strong>, where the soul searches for the one it loves:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“I sought him whom my soul loves… I found him, I held him, and would not let him go.”</em><br />
This is the felt tenacity of the Law of Assumption: once you find the inner state, you hold it fast until it becomes fact.</p>
</blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>3. Practices to Cultivate Love (Through Assumption)</strong></h3><p>These practices bring Neville’s principles into daily experience:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripture & Imagination</strong><br />
Read <em>1 John 4:8</em> and imagine <em>you</em> as love itself. Feel the warmth radiating from your chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assume Before Reacting</strong><br />
Before speaking or acting, pause. Ask, “What would someone who feels totally loved say or do right now?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Revision</strong><br />
Revise past hurts. See the scene differently—this time filled with mutual love, understanding, and peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Act 'As If'</strong><br />
Speak, move, and make decisions <em>as if</em> you are already deeply loved and loving. This aligns with both Scripture and Neville: walk by faith, not sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pray with Assumption</strong><br />
Blend biblical prayer and imaginal practice:<br />
“Father, let me feel Your love”—then feel <em>yourself</em> as the source and channel of that love.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Song of Solomon</em> provides poetic reinforcement here, especially in <strong>8:6–7</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Set me as a seal upon your heart… for love is strong as death… Many waters cannot quench love.”</em><br />
Love, once impressed upon the heart (the imagination), is unshakeable. The assumed state, when sealed, cannot be drowned by circumstance.</p>

<tr>
<th><strong>Biblical Love</strong></th>
<th><strong>Neville’s Love</strong></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Commanded by God (Deut 6:5)</td>
<td>Assumed as an inner state (“I AM love”)</td>

</tbody>
</table><p>Together, these views tell a unified story:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Love begins within—whether by divine command or conscious choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love must be <em>felt</em>, not just spoken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love, when persisted in, becomes real in your world.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Love is both divine essence and creative act. The Bible outlines its moral shape, while Neville Goddard teaches you to <em>embody</em> it through the Law of Assumption. You don’t wait to be loved—you <em>assume</em> it, feel it, and live from it. And in doing so, you prove the truth of both Scripture and imagination.</p><p>As <em>Song of Solomon 4:7</em> declares:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.”</em><br />
That is how the imagined self must be seen—whole, radiant, worthy. When you dare to accept yourself as already loved, the world cannot help but echo it back.</p></blockquote>
