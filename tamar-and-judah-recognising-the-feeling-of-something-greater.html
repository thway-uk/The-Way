    <h1>Tamar and Judah: Recognising the Feeling of Something Greater</h1>
    <p>**Now moved...***</p><p>Have you ever felt a deep, stirring sense that there is something more to life, something just beyond your grasp? Perhaps you've felt drawn to the Bible, even though its stories seem distant, complex, or hard to relate to. Maybe you've been searching for meaning or answers, but you can't quite work out what exactly you're seeking. It’s as if an inner desire is quietly urging you to explore something greater—something divine, yet mysterious.</p><p>In the story of Tamar and Judah (Genesis 38), there’s a valuable lesson for those on this journey, looking for a deeper understanding of the spiritual forces that shape our lives. On the surface, the story might seem strange, filled with actions that feel irrelevant or disconnected from modern life. However, when viewed through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings, this story reveals an important message about awakening to divine desire and the creative power of the subconscious mind. It shows the inner journey we all take when we long to manifest something greater, even when we're unsure of what that "something" is.</p><h3>Tamar: The Divine Instigator of Manifestation</h3><p>Tamar represents the subconscious mind—that fertile, unseen realm where all of our true desires are planted and nurtured. In Neville’s teachings, the subconscious is the soil where everything begins. It doesn’t judge, question, or limit—it simply receives and acts upon what is impressed upon it.</p><p>In this story, Tamar is not a passive figure; she is the one who instigates the divine movement. She doesn’t wait for life to change; she knows there is something more—something greater—that must come into being. This longing, this thirst for divine change, burns within her. And so, she acts—she initiates the spiritual breakthrough.</p><p>Tamar, disguised as a harlot ('loose' imagination as a 'temptress' that arouses desire) approaches Judah. This is a deliberate act, a spiritual gesture. In Neville’s view, this is not about deception—it’s about creating the right conditions in the subconscious mind to manifest the desired result. Tamar knows she is aligning herself with a higher law, and her action symbolises the consciousness of someone who is ready to bring a deeper truth into their world.</p><p>Her act reflects the impulse of the subconscious mind—quietly, patiently waiting for the right moment to break through into the conscious realm. It is the moment when divine desire begins to burst out from the depths of the soul. Tamar represents that feeling within us when we know there is something more, when we feel a divine urge to move forward, to make a change, to bring something new into being—even when we don’t fully understand it at the time.</p><p>This deep, stirring feeling in the heart—this inner desire for more—is the exact symbol of what Tamar represents. It is the divine urge within us that longs for spiritual growth, breakthrough, and manifestation. Just as Tamar instinctively moves to bring her desire into reality, we too are called to act on those deep, inexplicable feelings that awaken within us, urging us to seek something greater.</p><h3>Judah: The Unaware Outer Man</h3><p>Judah represents the outer consciousness, the surface mind that is often unaware of the deeper spiritual stirrings within. In Neville's teachings, the outer man is attached to the material world and focused on external circumstances. He operates based on logic and past experiences, disconnected from the inner spiritual law of creation.</p><p>When Judah “turns aside” to Tamar, he is acting on his own desires—but he is unaware of the deeper truth at play. In Neville’s terms, Judah is the outer man responding to the inner call of the subconscious mind, even though he doesn’t recognise it yet. His action triggers a transformation that will ultimately lead to a spiritual breakthrough, although he is unaware of the deeper forces at work.</p><p>Tamar’s role here is critical—she is the one who plants the seed in Judah’s subconscious, even though he is unaware of it. Just like the process of manifestation, the subconscious impresses desires upon the outer man, often without their conscious awareness. Judah’s response, though seemingly random, is in fact the manifestation of a deeper law at work, a law that Tamar has activated through her own spiritual initiative.</p><h3>The Thirst for More: A Spiritual Awakening</h3><p>When Judah turns to Tamar, he experiences a sense of desire—a thirst for something he can’t quite name. This thirst, in Neville’s framework, is the stirrings of divine imagination within the conscious mind. It is the desire that must be fulfilled, and it represents the longing for something greater, something beyond the ordinary world of appearances.</p><p>In Neville’s teachings, desire is the starting point of manifestation. It is the desire that stirs the subconscious, prompting it to bring forth the fulfilment of that desire. Judah’s desire to approach Tamar is a reflection of the spiritual yearning that often awakens within us when we feel there is more to life, when we long for something beyond the material world.</p><p>This thirst is not a random feeling—it is the imagination at work, calling forth a new reality. Tamar, as the subconscious mind, understands this. She knows that Judah’s thirst is not only a physical desire but a spiritual awakening, a stirring that will ultimately lead to a divine breakthrough.</p><h3>Judah’s Recognition: "She is More Righteous Than I Am"</h3><p>After Tamar reveals her identity and her actions are exposed, Judah, in a moment of profound self-awareness, admits, “She is more righteous than I am” (Genesis 38:26). On the surface, this may seem like a simple admission of guilt, but in Neville’s view, it represents a deeper, more significant realisation: Judah has come to recognise imagination as the true creative force.</p><p>Judah's acknowledgment of Tamar's righteousness isn’t merely a moral judgement; it is an inner recognition of her power as the imagination—the force of creation itself. Judah, the outer man, has been living from his surface desires, focused on external appearances. However, in this moment, he sees that Tamar, through her divine imagination (the subconscious mind), is the one who has brought about the desired result. She acted in alignment with the creative law, and this is what makes her "more righteous."</p><p>In essence, Judah realises that the true creative power is not in the external, physical world of action, but in the inner, imaginative world. Tamar’s actions were not based on external logic, but on the inner creative power of the subconscious mind. Judah’s statement, therefore, reflects his awakening to the fact that the imagination is the root of all creation, and that it is through the imagination that divine manifestation occurs.</p><p>This recognition is a profound shift in consciousness. Judah, now aware of the divine power within, begins to understand that the imagination is the true force of creation, and that it is through the imagination that divine manifestation occurs. Judah’s admission of Tamar’s righteousness is a realisation that the subconscious mind—through its desires and imagination—is the true creator of all things.</p><h3>Perez: The Breakthrough of Consciousness</h3><p>The union between Judah and Tamar leads to the birth of Perez, whose name means breach or breakthrough. In Neville’s language, this is the moment when a new state of consciousness is birthed into reality. Perez symbolises the breakthrough that comes when the subconscious mind has been impressed with a desire and that desire manifests in the outer world.</p><p>The birth of Perez is a powerful spiritual metaphor for how divine desires, when planted in the subconscious, ultimately break through into conscious awareness. It is the breakthrough that comes when the imagination is aligned with divine purpose, and the desires of the heart are allowed to manifest in the physical world.</p><p>This is the core of Neville’s teachings: when we align our inner desires with the divine law of manifestation, we activate a shift in consciousness that brings about the manifestation of those desires. Tamar, as the subconscious, teaches us that we must act on the divine impulses within us, trusting that they will lead to the breakthrough we seek.</p><p><br /></p>
