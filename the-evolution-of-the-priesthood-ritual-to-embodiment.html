<h1>The Evolution of the Priesthood: Ritual to Embodiment</h1>
<p></p>The priesthood in the Bible is a powerful symbol of our evolving relationship with imagination—our inner creative power that Neville Goddard identifies as God. By comparing the Old Testament priesthood with the New Testament priesthood that follows Jesus, we uncover profound parallels and shifts in consciousness that reflect the journey from subconscious ritual to conscious manifestation.<h3>Old Testament Priests: Aaron and the Levites as Mediators</h3><p>In the Old Testament, Aaron is appointed the first high priest, and the <a href="/2025/04/twelve-tribes-summary-law-of-assumption.html">tribe</a> of Levi is dedicated to priestly service (Exodus 28:1, Numbers 3:5–10). Their role is to mediate between God (pure awareness) and the people of <a href="/2025/04/israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel (formational response to the law of Assumption)</a>, maintaining the Tabernacle rituals and purity laws (Leviticus 8–10).</p><p><strong>Key Passages:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Exodus 28:1</em> — “Bring Aaron your brother... to serve me as priest.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Leviticus 16</em> — The Day of Atonement ritual, cleansing the people of sin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Numbers 8:14</em> — The Levites are given to serve in the Tabernacle.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville would interpret these priests as representing the inner emotional and imaginative work needed to hold and maintain a new assumed state of being. The rituals and laws are symbolic of cleansing imaginative blocks and sustaining the creative imagination’s power. Aaron as high priest embodies the union between  awareness (God) and the collective mind gathered in response to the assumption (Israel).</p><h3>New Testament Priests: The Royal Priesthood and Direct Access</h3><p>The New Testament shifts this dynamic dramatically. Believers are called a “royal priesthood” (1 Peter 2:9), invited to approach God directly through Jesus (Son – Imagination in union with the Father – I AM) who is the perfect High Priest (Hebrews 4:14–16).</p><p><strong>Key Passages:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>1 Peter 2:9</em> — “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hebrews 4:14–16</em> — Jesus as the great High Priest who sympathises and intercedes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hebrews 7:23–28</em> — Jesus’ eternal priesthood, once for all.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Neville’s teaching shows that this represents the evolved state of consciousness where imagination is fully realised and embodied. The <a href="/search/label/Crucifixion%20Series">crucifixion</a> and resurrection of <a href="/2025/06/jesus-as-mind-that-saves-itself-neville.html">Jesus</a> symbolise the fixing of the new state, making repeated rituals unnecessary. Believers become deliberate creators, living out their assumed state of being with faith, not ritual.</p><hr /><h3>The Pattern of Manifestation: From Ritual to Faith</h3><table>

</table><p>Neville would say the Old Testament priesthood is the necessary training ground—where imagination must be disciplined and purified. The New Testament priesthood reveals the fulfilment of this process: living fully in the “I AM,” creating consciously without dependence on external rituals.</p>
