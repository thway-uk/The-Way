    <h1>Illuminating 2 Chronicles 7:16–21 Through the Law of Assumption</h1>
    <p></p><blockquote>“For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.”</blockquote><p></p>
This passage from 2 Chronicles 7:16, when viewed through the law of assumption, reveals a profound truth about how our inner states create reality. The “house” God consecrates is the state of consciousness we inhabit—the inner space where our assumed identity or belief lives. God’s “name” in this house is the assumption we hold to be true, the identity we live by.
<h3>“My Name” — The Assumed Identity That Creates Reality</h3>
<p>“My name” refers to the specific assumption or belief we choose to identify with. According to the law of assumption, what we persistently assume to be true becomes our reality. To have God’s name in the house forever means to firmly establish that assumption within ourselves, making it our constant state of being.</p>
<h3>“My Eyes and My Heart Will Be There for All Time” — Living the Assumption with Feeling</h3>
<p>God’s “eyes” represent the act of imagining our assumption vividly, with focused attention. The “heart” represents the feeling that brings life and reality to that assumption. Together, they describe the practice of <strong>living in the end</strong>—seeing and feeling the fulfilled desire clearly and persistently in imagination. This sustained focus and feeling impress the subconscious and manifest the assumed reality in the physical world.</p>
<h3>Consecrating the House — Choosing and Maintaining Your Assumption</h3>
<p>To “choose and consecrate this house” means to deliberately inhabit and maintain your chosen assumption, treating it as sacred. This is an ongoing inner commitment to live as if your desire is already fulfilled, continually nurturing your assumption through imagination and feeling.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>2 Chronicles 7:16–21 reminds us that the reality we experience is shaped by the assumptions we hold. By choosing and consecrating your inner house with a clear assumption—God’s “name”—and by living it with “eyes and heart,” or imagination and feeling, you align yourself with the creative power that manifests your desires.</p>
