<h1>Moses: Red Sea</h1>
<p>The story of the Red Sea crossing in <em>Exodus 14</em> is often told as a tale of divine deliverance and spectacle. Yet beneath its dramatic imagery lies a potent symbolic map of the inner journey — one that aligns beautifully with Neville Goddard’s teachings on imagination, faith, and the transformation of self.</p>
<h3><strong>Egypt: The Old State of Being</strong></h3>
<p>The Israelites in bondage to Pharaoh symbolise the individual held captive by a limiting state of consciousness. Egypt is not merely a place — it is a mindset. It represents all the ingrained beliefs, fears, and assumptions that have enslaved the imagination. Pharaoh, as the tyrant of this realm, is the dominating thought structure — the egoic authority that refuses to let the individual dream freely or rise above their current condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It would have been better for us to be the servants of the Egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land.”</em> (Exodus 14:12, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we hear the voice of the old man — the fearful self clinging to familiar suffering rather than daring to imagine something greater.</p>
<h3><strong>Moses: The Awakened Imagination</strong></h3>
<p>Moses, raised in the palace of Pharaoh but drawn away to a higher calling, symbolises the emergence of the awakened imagination. He hears the call of "I AM" in the wilderness — the realisation of one's divine creative power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do not be afraid; take your place and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will give you today: for the Egyptians whom you see today, you will never see again.”</em> (Exodus 14:13, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This moment represents inner conviction. The old self screams in panic, but the awakened imagination does not flinch. It knows that appearances are not final.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lord will make war for you, you have only to keep quiet.”</em> (Exodus 14:14, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the pivotal point in any manifestation: the imagination must not be swayed by the senses, even when the situation appears impossible.</p>
<h3><strong>The Sea: Subconscious Passage</strong></h3>
<p>The Red Sea itself represents the subconscious — vast, deep, and capable of both drowning and delivering. To cross it is to pass through the inner shift where a new belief must be impressed upon the subconscious, parting the waters of doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why are you crying out to me? Give the children of Israel the order to go forward.”</em> (Exodus 14:15, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forward — despite the appearance of a sea blocking the way. This is the inner movement required to shift states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea, and it will be parted in two; and the children of Israel will go through on dry land.”</em> (Exodus 14:16, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville taught that the subconscious accepts the feeling of the wish fulfilled. As the Israelites move forward into the sea, they do so in faith, with no physical evidence of safety.</p>
<h3><strong>Pharaoh’s Army: The Pursuing Past</strong></h3>
<p>Pharaoh's army rushing in after them symbolises the relentless pursuit of old thoughts and fears. When one begins to change, the past often tries to pull the self back into conformity. Old beliefs don’t die quietly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And the Egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses and his war-carriages and his horsemen.”</em> (Exodus 14:23, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Red Sea does not permit the old man to cross.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And when Moses put out his hand over the sea, it came back to its place: and the Egyptians, in flight, went against it; and the Lord overcame the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.”</em><br />
<em>“And the waters came back, covering the war-carriages and the horsemen and all the army… not one of them was to be seen.”</em> (Exodus 14:27–28, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What no longer serves cannot follow where you’ve gone. The subconscious accepts the new state and buries the old.</p>
<h3><strong>The Other Side: A New Identity</strong></h3>
<p>On the far shore of the sea stands the true beginning of identity reformation. The people who were once slaves now sing a new song of freedom. They have crossed over. And though their physical circumstances may still be developing, something fundamental has shifted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So that day the Lord gave Israel salvation from the hands of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea’s edge.”</em><br />
<em>“And Israel saw the great work which the Lord did against the Egyptians: and the people had fear of the Lord and faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses.”</em> (Exodus 14:30–31, BBE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your own journey, the “Red Sea” moment is always available — that point where you choose to feel yourself into a new assumption and act from it, regardless of what the world shows. The way opens <em>as you move</em>. And the old fears, once so threatening, cannot follow where you’ve gone.</p>
