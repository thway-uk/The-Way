<h1>“Spiritual Truth” and Other Things We Say When We Don’t Know What We’re Talking About</h1>
<p>There are few phrases thrown around in the spiritual space with as much vague authority as <strong>“spiritual truth.”</strong> Say it with a straight face and a distant gaze and you’ll sound like you know things. Deep things. Cosmic things. Probably about Lemuria. Or chakras. Or where to put your selenite.</p><p>But what <strong>is</strong> a “spiritual truth,” really? And did Neville Goddard ever use the term while swaying in a kaftan and whispering, “You just have to trust the divine timing of your quantum leap”?</p><p>(He did not. He wore suits. He smoked. He spoke in that wonderful 1940s Transatlantic accent that makes everything sound like it's being announced over a wireless.)</p><hr /><h3><strong>So... What Is a Spiritual Truth According to Neville?</strong></h3><p>Let’s clear the incense: Neville wasn’t throwing around the term like it was Himalayan salt. For him, a spiritual truth wasn’t something you found in a dreamcatcher or written on a driftwood sign at a yoga retreat. It was simple. Sharp. Unsentimental.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Your imagination creates reality. That’s the spiritual truth.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>No fluff. No chanting. No need to realign your crystals under a blood moon.</p><p>Neville’s so-called “spiritual truths” were statements about <strong>consciousness</strong> and <strong>identity</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>God is <strong>I AM</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are what you <strong>believe</strong> yourself to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your inner conversations become your <strong>outer world</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bible is a psychological drama, not a religious history lesson.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>That’s it. No tarot decks were harmed in the making of these revelations.</p><hr /><h3><strong>When People Say “Spiritual Truth” But Mean “Vague Vibe”</strong></h3><p>Let’s be honest: sometimes “spiritual truth” is code for <strong>“I saw this on Instagram and it felt vibey.”</strong></p><p>You’ve heard it:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>“It’s my spiritual truth that I only answer texts during Mercury retrograde.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Spiritual truth: avocado is a portal to the 5D.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“That’s just <em>my</em> truth.”<br />
(That one’s a favourite of anyone who doesn’t want to be disagreed with.)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>But Neville wasn’t concerned with “my truth” or “your truth.” He was after <strong>The Truth</strong>—and not in a preachy way, but in a <em>test-it-for-yourself</em> way. If imagining a new state changes your experience, then boom: you’ve found a <strong>spiritual truth</strong>. And you didn’t even need to decode your birth chart.</p><hr /><h3><strong>How to Tell If It's a Neville-Approved Spiritual Truth</strong></h3><p>Here’s a quick test:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Does it empower you as the operant power?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does it point to imagination as God in action?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can it be lived, tested, and proven—not just posted on Pinterest?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p>If yes: Congratulations, you’ve got yourself a Neville-level spiritual truth.
If not: It might just be a very fancy opinion in a silk wrapper.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Final Thoughts (aka: My Truth, But Actually Neville’s)</strong></h3><p>Neville didn’t sprinkle his lectures with spiritual buzzwords. He gave you the key and told you to turn it:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Dare to assume you are what you want to be, and you will become it.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>That’s the real deal. No need to sage your hallway or bathe in moonlight—unless, of course, that makes you feel powerful. In which case, knock yourself out. Just don’t forget the <strong>real</strong> spiritual truth:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>You are God, imagining. That’s it. That’s the post.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p><br /></p>
