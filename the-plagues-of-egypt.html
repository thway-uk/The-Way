    <h1>The Plagues of Egypt</h1>
    <p></p>
<p>The story of the plagues is not about a divine temper tantrum or cosmic punishment. It is a vivid symbolic account of what happens internally when the heart resists the truth of imagination. Pharaoh is not a villain in a history book — he is the <b><a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">mind in its stubbornness</a></b>, refusing to release the enslaved thoughts (Israel) into their higher expression.</p>
<p>Each plague is a reflection of internal disorder. They do not come from without, but from within — signs of a <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">mind at war</a> with its own higher knowing. Genesis 1:26 says, <em>“<a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">Let us make man in our image, after our likeness</a>.”</em> But Pharaoh, symbolising Egypt or the lower mind, refuses to acknowledge that image. He clings to appearances, to the belief in separation, powerlessness, and reaction.</p>
<p>When man denies his divine image — that he is imagination itself, the creative power — he begins to fracture internally. As Genesis 4:7 warns, <em>“Sin lies at the door. And unto you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over <a href="/p/genesis-126-man.html">him</a>.”</em> Sin, as Neville Goddard teaches, is simply <a href="/search/label/Hitting%20Or%20Missing%20the%20Mark%20%28AIM%29%20Series">missing the mark</a> — reacting in fear instead of assuming in <a href="/p/genesis-224-love.html">love</a>.</p>
<p>The plagues are the psychological and emotional consequences of repeatedly missing that mark. Like Cain, who killed his brother in a fit of envy, Pharaoh's resistance leads to inner chaos. And like Lamech in Genesis 4:24, who declares <em>“If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold,”</em> the <a href="/2025/07/cain-lamech-and-jesus-psychology-of.html">torment multiplies when one continues in that angry state</a>. This is not vengeance from an external God — it is the self-inflicted wound of resisting the truth of one's being, repeated “<a href="/search/label/Numbers%3A%20Seven">seventy and sevenfold</a>” through cycles of fear, doubt, and hardness of heart.</p>
<p>These are not literal punishments. They are the plague-like symptoms of a <a href="/p/genesis-47-sin.html">man out of alignment with himself</a>. The frogs, lice, and darkness are grotesque symbols of internal unrest. They appear until finally, in the <b>death of the firstborn — the most precious assumption, the ego’s beloved idea — the mind breaks, and lets go.</b></p>
<p>Only then does Israel begin to leave — not as a race of people, but as the liberated thoughts that can now journey toward the Promised Land: the <a href="/p/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">fulfilled assumption</a>.</p><h3><strong>Water Turned to Blood – Contaminated Imagination</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
The first plague begins when Pharaoh refuses to acknowledge that <strong>Moses and Aaron’s message</strong> is legitimate. They perform signs before Pharaoh, and Pharaoh, his heart hardened, rejects them. When Moses strikes the Nile with his staff, the water turns to blood, symbolising how the flow of the <strong>spirit</strong> (the waters) is blocked or tainted when we refuse to open our hearts to change.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
This plague symbolises the contamination of your imagination by negative emotions and beliefs. When you resist embracing your own creative power, your spiritual flow becomes tainted, and your ability to manifest positive change is disrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider the negative thoughts and limiting beliefs that cloud your mind, preventing the creative flow of imagination. This plague <strong>begins</strong> when you refuse to release old fears and doubts, causing your thoughts to become stagnant.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Frogs – Mental Clutter and Overstimulation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
Pharaoh once again rejects Moses and Aaron's warning, and when the frogs emerge from the Nile, they overwhelm the land. Pharaoh is left surrounded by frogs, unable to avoid their presence. This plague begins when the <strong>mind resists stillness</strong>, instead allowing distractions and excess thoughts to take over.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
The frogs represent mental clutter—an overload of thoughts that distract you from clarity and inner peace. When you resist focusing your imagination on constructive thoughts, you become overwhelmed by scattered, chaotic thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You might face a situation where, instead of focusing on one positive thought, your mind becomes consumed with worries and distractions. The plague of frogs <strong>begins</strong> when you fail to control your mental environment, allowing negative thinking to overwhelm your inner peace.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Lice – Irritations from Small Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
As Pharaoh’s heart remains hardened, the plague of lice comes next. The dust of the earth becomes lice, representing how tiny, seemingly insignificant irritations begin to grow and multiply. The plague begins when the <strong>small, negative thoughts</strong> are ignored and allowed to fester.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
Lice represent the small, nagging thoughts that infiltrate your mind and disrupt your peace. These seemingly harmless thoughts—doubts, insecurities, and fleeting irritations—build up and cause mental discomfort when you do not address them early.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You might have recurring, negative thoughts about your abilities, appearance, or past mistakes. These thoughts multiply and become a source of agitation. The plague of lice <strong>begins</strong> when you fail to confront and release these minor irritations, allowing them to grow and affect your mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Flies – Corruption in the Subconscious</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
Once again, Pharaoh’s refusal to let the Israelites go leads to the plague of flies. The flies swarm and invade the homes of the Egyptians, representing how the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> becomes clouded with negative patterns. This plague begins when the subconscious mind is filled with outdated beliefs and emotional baggage.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
The <a href="/2025/04/jesus-wept-for-easter-sunday.html">flies</a> represent the way unresolved issues, past experiences, and unconscious fears <strong>cloud your judgment</strong> and hinder progress. When you refuse to let go of the past, your subconscious begins to fill with negative residue that distorts your perception of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Perhaps you’ve experienced trauma or carry unresolved feelings from the past. These unresolved emotions can manifest as <strong>mental flies</strong>, clouding your thinking and preventing you from seeing clearly. The plague <strong>begins</strong> when you refuse to release old baggage, allowing it to invade your present reality.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Death of Livestock – Collapse of Outer Support</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
In response to Pharaoh’s persistent hardening of heart, the plague of livestock disease strikes. The cattle and animals of Egypt die, symbolising the loss of outer forms of security. This plague begins when we hold too tightly to <strong>external sources of support</strong>, rather than trusting our inner strength and creative imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
This plague represents the <strong>loss of external support</strong>—whether it's job security, relationships, or material wealth—when we rely on external sources instead of our inner resources. The loss happens when we resist trusting in the power of our inner imagination to create and manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You might lose a job or experience some external setback, and this loss can feel catastrophic. The plague <strong>begins</strong> when you place all your faith in external circumstances instead of recognising your inner power to transform your life.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Boils – Inner Torment Breaking Through</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
The plague of boils comes next, appearing as sores on the bodies of the Egyptians. This begins when Pharaoh refuses to humble himself, and the <strong>torment of suppressed emotions</strong> rises to the surface. The boils are a physical manifestation of inner torment and guilt that has been ignored for too long.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
Boils represent the <strong>manifestation of unresolved emotional pain</strong>. These internal conflicts, guilt, and shame cannot remain suppressed forever. The plague <strong>begins</strong> when we refuse to confront these feelings and allow them to fester.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You may experience emotional discomfort or pain that you’ve been avoiding. This plague <strong>begins</strong> when you refuse to acknowledge and deal with these internal struggles, letting them manifest as physical or emotional distress.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hail and Fire – Emotional Upheaval and Internal Conflict</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How It Began</strong>:<br />
The hail and fire plague strikes after Pharaoh’s repeated resistance to change. The fiery hail represents <strong>emotional chaos and inner conflict</strong>, and this plague begins when there is an <strong>intense clash of old beliefs with new possibilities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Meaning</strong>:<br />
Hail and fire represent the <strong>violent clash of opposing forces</strong> within the psyche. This plague <strong>begins</strong> when you resist the internal conflict that arises during moments of spiritual growth. It’s a sign that the old self is fighting against the new, creating emotional turmoil.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You may feel torn between your old ways of thinking and new, more empowering beliefs. The inner conflict intensifies and the <strong>plague</strong> begins when you resist reconciling these opposing forces.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each plague begins as a result of <strong>resistance</strong>—the refusal to accept change and let go of outdated beliefs. In the spiritual sense, they reflect the growing discomfort within us when we persist in holding onto an old state of consciousness, rather than allowing transformation to take place.</p>
