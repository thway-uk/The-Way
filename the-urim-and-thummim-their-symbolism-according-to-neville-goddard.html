    <h1>The Urim and Thummim: Their Symbolism According to Neville Goddard</h1>
    <p>In the Bible, two <a href="/search/label/Object%20Symbolism">sacred objects</a>—the <strong>Urim and Thummim</strong>—were carried by <a href="/2025/04/israel-symbolism-according-to-neville.html">Israel’s High Priest</a> in the <a href="/2025/04/aaron-in-neville-goddards-teachings.html">breastplate</a> of <a href="/2025/05/judgement-and-righteousness-neville.html">judgment</a> (Exodus 28:30). Their exact function remains mysterious, yet their symbolism fits beautifully within Neville Goddard’s teachings on imagination and manifestation. These objects offer us insight into the divine power within ourselves to manifest our desires.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Urim: The Light of Imagination</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Biblical Anchor:</strong> The word <em>Urim</em> comes from <em>’or</em> (Hebrew for “light,” Exodus 28:30; Deuteronomy 33:8).</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong> Imagination is the light that illuminates our inner world. Just as the Urim provided divine “light” to Israel, our imagination lights the way to what we wish to manifest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Psalm 119:105 – “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “lamp” is the inner light of imagination, guiding us toward the reality we choose to create. In Hebrew symbolism, light is not merely illumination but <strong>revelation</strong>—the dawning of an inner knowing.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Thummim: The Truth of Our Being</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Biblical Anchor:</strong> <em>Thummim</em> derives from <em>t-h-m</em>, meaning “perfection” or “completeness” (Exodus 28:30; Numbers 27:21).</p>
<p><strong>Neville’s Insight:</strong> Manifestation relies on recognising your inherent <strong><a href="/2025/05/creation-is-finished-stepping-into.html">completeness</a></strong>—<a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">the belief that your desire already exists</a> in the realm of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>. To manifest effectively, you must hold the truth that everything you desire is already yours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John 8:32 – “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Thummim</em> represents the truth that you are already one with what you seek. It is the steady knowing that unlocks the gates of fulfilled desire. Together, <strong>Urim</strong> and <strong>Thummim</strong> are not just “yes” or “no” devices—they are the <strong>light of assumption</strong> and the <strong>truth of fulfilment</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Sevenfold Completeness and the Law of Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>The word <em>Thummim</em> contains the idea of <strong><a href="/2025/05/creation-is-finished-stepping-into.html">completion</a></strong>—and this connects symbolically to the <strong>number seven</strong>, the sacred symbol of <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html"><strong>wholeness</strong>, <strong>cycle fulfilment</strong>, and <strong>spiritual perfection</strong></a> in the Bible.</p>
<p>In <strong>Genesis 1</strong>, God creates the world in <strong>six days</strong> and <strong>rests on the seventh</strong>. This is not merely a literal creation story, but the <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html"><strong>first symbolic teaching of manifestation</strong>:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imagination (Urim)</strong> begins the process (Let there be light).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Completion (Thummim)</strong> marks its fulfilment (And it was very good).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>seven days</strong> represent the complete arc from <strong>assumption to embodiment</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Hebrew Letters and the Mathers Table</strong></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Mathers Table of the Hebrew alphabet</a>, each letter corresponds to a number. The Hebrew word for <em>Thummim</em> (תֻּמִּים‎) is built upon the letter <strong>Tav (ת)</strong>, which is the <strong>last letter of the Hebrew alphabet</strong>, often symbolising <strong>completion, seal, or finality</strong>. In the Mathers Table:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tav (ת)</strong> = <strong>400</strong>, the highest individual value, representing culmination or fulfilment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hebrew alphabet itself contains <strong>22 letters</strong>—and when added to the sacred <strong>5 final forms</strong>, we arrive again at <strong>27</strong>, another numerical form of 3³, or the cube of wholeness. BOTA is a society based on the model of the cube.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The interplay between letters and numbers in Hebrew mysticism teaches that <strong>numbers are not abstract</strong>—they are <strong>active powers</strong>. Just as <em>Urim</em> aligns with <strong>Aleph (א)</strong> and <strong>light</strong>—the initiator, <em>Thummim</em> aligns with <strong>Tav (ת)</strong>—the fulfiller. These are the <strong>Alpha and Omega</strong>, the beginning and end of creation, both within you.</p>

<h3><strong>Menorah: Seven Lights of Creative Consciousness</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exodus 25:31 – “Make a lampstand of pure gold…with its seven lamps.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neville likened your inner world to a <strong>seven-branched lampstand</strong>: each lamp a facet, or <a href="/2025/05/the-inner-creation-story-unfolding.html">day</a> of your <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a>—imagination, faith, feeling, assumption, focus, knowing, and fulfilment. The <strong>Urim’s light</strong> and the <strong>Thummim’s truth</strong> together ignite all seven. You, like the High Priest, bear the inner tools for illumination and judgement—the <strong>oracle of the soul</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Creation, Oracle, and Inner Authority</strong></h3>
<p>The creation story in Genesis is not a historical record but a <strong>template for manifestation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Day One: <em>Let there be light</em> (Urim – the spark of imagination)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day Seven: <em>He rested</em> (Thummim – the knowing it is done)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And just as the priests consulted Urim and Thummim for divine decisions, <strong>you consult your own inner oracle</strong>—not with outward rituals but with <strong>inner feeling</strong>. Neville’s method is nothing less than a return to the Edenic act of creation: the Word spoken, the Light imagined, and the Truth rested in.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Sevenfold Manifestation – Light and Truth United</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Urim</strong> = <em>Light of imagination</em> — the first step, the “yes” to possibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thummim</strong> = <em>Truth of being</em> — the settled assurance of completion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, they form your <strong>spiritual oracle</strong>: one reveals the path, the other affirms its end. The seven days of Genesis, the seven lamps of the Menorah, and the sevenfold process of imagination all echo the divine pattern of <strong>manifestation through completeness</strong>.</p>
<p>You are the High Priest of your <a href="/2025/05/building-with-imagination-solomon-as.html">own temple</a>. Stand between Urim and Thummim. Let imagination light your way, and let truth confirm it is already done.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
