    <h1>God - The Wind and the Window Symbolism</h1>
    <p></p>
<p></p><blockquote>"Then the LORD answered Job out of the <i><b>whirlwind</b></i>." — Job 38:1</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>"And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening <b><i>wind</i></b>." — Genesis 3:8</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>In the Bible, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God</a> is often symbolised by wind or breath— a force that is invisible yet powerful, ever-present, and transformative. Through Neville’s framework and the encoded imagery of the <a href="/2025/05/the-mathers-table-unlocking-mystical.html">Hebrew alphabet</a>, we see that each letter corresponds to a symbolic object — such as a house, window, camel, or door. These are not random images but psychological metaphors. The “house,” for example, can be understood as the head — the seat of <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">consciousness</a> and imagination. Just as the house holds all <a href="/2025/05/in-my-fathers-house-john-142-3.html">rooms</a> within it, the head holds all states and self-concepts. The window then becomes the opening in this house — the point through which the unseen creative wind (spirit) moves into form and expression.</p><h3><strong>God as Wind in the Bible: Symbol of Invisible Power</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible uses the symbol of <strong>wind and breath</strong> in multiple ways, often to represent <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God’s</a> presence, power, and spirit, </strong>that which we breathe life into consciously<strong>. </strong>Here are a few references to explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>John 3:8</strong> – <em>“The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit..”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genesis 1:2</strong> – <em>“And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”</em> (Here, the word “Spirit” is often interpreted as <strong>wind</strong> or <strong>breath</strong> in some translations.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 37:9-10</strong> – <em>“Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind… and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.”</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In these instances, the <strong>wind</strong> represents <strong><a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God’s Spirit</a></strong>—something that <strong>moves</strong> within, shaping creation and bringing life where there was none. It’s a symbol of <strong>spiritual energy</strong> or <strong>creative power</strong>, which aligns with Neville’s teachings about imagination being the divine creative force within each person.</p>

<h3><strong>Connecting the Window and Wind in Neville’s Interpretation</strong></h3>
<p>Now, let’s tie this all together with Neville Goddard’s understanding of <strong>imagination</strong> and <strong>consciousness</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Imagination as the Window to the Spirit (Wind)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Neville’s view, imagination is the <strong>gateway to the spiritual world</strong>, a <strong>window</strong> that opens into the realm of possibility, where God’s creative power moves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>wind</strong> (God’s Spirit) is like the <strong>energy</strong> or <strong>force</strong> that fuels your imagination. It’s the invisible power that works <strong>through you</strong> and <strong>within you</strong>, just as wind cannot be seen but can be felt and observed through its effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you use your <strong>imagination (window)</strong> to focus on a desire or vision, you are <strong>tuning into this divine wind</strong>. You’re allowing God’s Spirit to move through you and bring your inner vision into tangible reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind as Imagination's Power</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wind is <strong>unseen but felt</strong>, just as your imagination is a force you cannot always see directly, but you feel its power in your life. Neville would say that this “wind” moves through you when you <strong>hold a vision</strong> and <strong>live in the feeling</strong> of the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>wind of God</strong> isn’t a distant or external force—it is <strong>inside you</strong>, moving through your thoughts and feelings, shaping your inner world. Your <strong>imagination</strong> is the medium through which this divine power flows into physical manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Window and Wind: A Flow of Creation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>window</strong> symbolizes an <strong>opening</strong> to the inner world of imagination, while the <strong>wind</strong> represents the <strong>spiritual power</strong> moving through that opening. In a sense, the window is <strong>your conscious awareness</strong>, and the wind is <strong>the spirit of creation</strong> that flows through your consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neville might say: <strong>By opening the window of your imagination</strong> (focusing your mind and feelings on your desire), you allow the <strong>wind (God’s spirit)</strong> to blow through you and create the reality you envision. Without the wind, there is no movement—without the window, there is no access to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Bringing It All Together: Wind, Window, and Imagination</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Wind</strong> (God's Spirit) is the <strong>creative force</strong> that is always present and available, but it requires an <strong>opening</strong> to flow through and shape your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Window</strong> is your <strong>imagination</strong>, the point where your mind and the invisible world of spirit meet. It’s the <strong>gate</strong> through which the <strong>wind</strong> (spiritual power) enters and <strong>transforms</strong> your physical reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imagination</strong>, as Neville taught, is the <strong>active use of this window</strong>, where the <strong>wind of God</strong> (spiritual energy) moves through and brings your mental images into physical form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neville would say that <strong>God as wind</strong> and <strong>imagination as the window</strong> are not separate from you, but part of the <strong>divine nature within you</strong>. Just as wind cannot be controlled but can be directed, so too can your imagination direct the flow of God’s creative power to manifest your desires.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Window and Wind as Symbols of Transformation</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville’s teachings, both the <strong>window</strong> and the <strong>wind</strong> are symbols of the <strong>inner power</strong> that resides within us. The <strong>window</strong> is our consciousness, and the <strong>wind</strong> is the <strong>Spirit of God</strong>—the invisible creative force that shapes the world. By opening the window of imagination, we allow the wind of God’s Spirit to flow through and create, bringing about transformation in our lives.</p>
<p>As Neville often said, <strong>“Imagination is the only redemptive power in the universe.”</strong> The wind (Spirit) moves through the window (your imagination) to create a new reality. And when we recognize that <strong>we are the window through which God’s power flows</strong>, we begin to see the <strong>divine in all things</strong>.</p>
