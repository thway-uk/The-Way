    <h1>Hearing the Word of God</h1>
    <p>Throughout Scripture, “hearing” signifies more than the physical sense—it is the inner reception of the <a href="/2025/05/the-word-seed-and-unity-of-consciousness.html">Word of God — the assumption </a>, the very <a href="/2025/04/genesis-111-and-seed-within-neville.html">seed of manifestation</a> in your imagination. In Neville’s system, nothing becomes real until it is first assumed and heard inwardly. Thus, hearing is the first step in the <a href="/2025/05/ask-believe-receive-reaching-for.html">law of assumption</a>: you must accept a new state in imagination before it can appear in your outer world.</p><hr /><h2>The Continuum of Hearing: A Thread Running Through the Bible</h2><p>Every <a href="/search/label/Names%20and%20Genealogies%20Series">name</a> and story associated with hearing maps a stage in the unfolding of consciousness through imagination. As you move from Samuel to Shammah, you trace the journey from first assumption to the fixing of that assumption as reality.</p><h3>Samuel – “God Has Heard”</h3><p>Samuel’s name and story represent the awakening of imagination. When he says, “Speak, <a href="/2025/06/the-meaning-of-lord-god-according-to.html">Lord</a>, for your servant hears,” he enacts the law of assumption’s opening act: inner stillness and willingness to receive a new conception. This is the moment of first assumption, when imagination listens and accepts the unseen Word.</p><h3>Simeon / Simon – “He Who Has Heard”</h3><p>Simeon in the temple and Simon Peter both illustrate recognition of what imagination has assumed. Simeon inwardly perceives the Christ child; Peter inwardly recognises Jesus as the Christ. In Neville’s terms, their inner hearing yields unshakeable faith—a conviction born of imagination rather than outer proof.</p><h3>Shimei – “Yah Has Heard”</h3><p>Shimei’s cursing of David symbolises the misuse of imagination: he has “heard” only negative appearances and assumed them as reality. Neville warns that the law of assumption works both ways—what you assume inwardly, whether positive or negative, will manifest. Shimei reminds us to govern our inner hearing with care.</p><h3>Peter – “The Rock of Faith”</h3><p>When Simon becomes Peter, he moves from hearing to fixing. Jesus declares, “You are Peter…,” and Neville interprets this as the moment when an assumption is so firmly held in imagination that it becomes the “rock” upon which new reality is built. Here, the law of assumption is in full effect: assume and persist until the outer world conforms.</p><h3>Ishmael – “God Will Hear”</h3><p>Ishmael’s birth represents the emotional assumption—the soul’s first cry of desire. Born of Hagar’s fear, his name nevertheless shows that the law of assumption hears any inner desire. Even unconscious assumptions bear fruit; Ishmael reminds us that every inner state is recognised by imagination.</p><h3>Shemaiah – “Heard by the Lord”</h3><p>As a prophet who both hears and acts, Shemaiah embodies the application of the law of assumption. He listens inwardly and then expresses that reality outwardly. In Neville’s framework, this is the stage where imagination guides your thoughts, words, and deeds in alignment with the new state.</p><h3>Shammah – “Hearing” (or “Desolation”)</h3><p>Shammah’s defense of the lentil field symbolises the persistence required by the law of assumption. When outer circumstances challenge your assumption, you must defend your inner hearing—holding your imagined state steady until it externalises. Persistence in assumption is the key to overcoming appearances.</p><hr /><h2>Jesus’ Call: “Let Him Who Has Ears to Hear, Hear”</h2><p>When <a href="/p/jesus-christ-salvation.html">Jesus</a> says, “Let him who has ears, let him hear,” He refers not to physical hearing but to the imaginative faculty that receives the creative Word. Neville interprets this as a direct invitation: accept and persist in the assumption that you already are the new state. Hearing here is pure agreement in imagination—the conscious choice to assume the unseen as true.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Faith comes by hearing,” writes Paul (Romans 10:17).<br />
In Neville’s vocabulary, faith is simply the assured assumption born from inner hearing.</p>
</blockquote><p>Jesus uses <strong>“He who has ears to hear, let him hear”</strong> multiple times across the Gospels, underscoring the importance of spiritual discernment and the active reception of His teachings.</p><h3>Instances in the Gospels</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 11:15</strong> – After denouncing unrepentant cities, Jesus declares, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 13:9</strong> – Following the Parable of the Sower, He emphasises the need to understand the message: “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matthew 13:43</strong> – In explaining the Parable of the Weeds: “Then the righteous will shine like the sun… He who has ears, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mark 4:9</strong>, <strong>4:23</strong>, <strong>7:16</strong> – In each context—teaching parables or addressing the crowd—Jesus repeats, “If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke 8:8</strong> – After the Parable of the Sower, He calls again, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Luke 14:35</strong> – Concluding a teaching on discipleship’s cost: “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In total, this phrase appears <strong>eight times</strong> in the Gospels, highlighting its central role in Jesus’ ministry. A parallel refrain in Revelation addresses the seven churches: “Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches” (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).</p><hr /><h2>Women in the Old Testament: “My Lord Has Heard Me”</h2><p>Women of Scripture also demonstrate stages of assumption through their declarations of having been heard:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hannah (“The Lord Has Heard”)</strong>: In 1 Samuel 1:20, her answered prayer reflects her assumption, in imagination, that she already has her son.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rachel (“God Has Heard Me”)</strong>: By naming Dan, she assumes the state of motherhood and aligns her imagination with that reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sarah (“God Has Made Laughter”)</strong>: Her laughter signals the realisation of her assumption; inwardly hearing God’s promise produces joy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These accounts reinforce that hearing in imagination transcends gender: every inner declaration shapes outer reality once assumed and persisted in.</p><hr /><h2>The Thread Deepens the Symbolism of Manifestation</h2><p>Tracing these names in biblical order reveals the gradual deepening of the law of assumption:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Samuel</strong> – First assumption in stillness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simeon / Simon</strong> – Recognition and faith formed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shimei</strong> – Warning: negative assumption also works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> – Fixing the assumption as bedrock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ishmael</strong> – Inner desire heard, unconsciously assumed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shemaiah</strong> – Applying assumption in action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shammah</strong> – Persisting against doubt</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Woven through it all is Jesus’ call: those with imaginative “ears” must hear—that is, assume—the unseen state and hold it until it materialises.</p><hr /><h3>Conclusion: Hearing as the Gateway to Creation</h3><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, imagination is God, and the law of assumption is the mechanism by which the unseen becomes seen. Hearing is the first movement of that law—the moment you receive the seed of a new state. Once you hear, assume, and persist, the outer world must eventually conform.</p><p>







































</p><p>So when you read, “Let him who has ears to hear, let him hear,” take it as a personal instruction: listen inwardly, assume your desire fulfilled, and persist until your world reflects the fullness of your imaginative hearing.</p>
