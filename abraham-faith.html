    <title>Abraham: Faith</title>

<body>
    <h1>Abraham: Faith</h1>
    <p>Neville Goddard taught that the Bible is not a record of ancient history but a psychological drama, unfolding in the life of every individual. For Neville, <a href="/2025/07/abraham-promise-and-covenant.html">the <strong>Promise</strong> is not a metaphor—it is <strong>a literal assurance</strong> that what you imagine with faith will become fact</a>. The stories in Scripture, especially those of Abraham, reveal this hidden law: <strong>that assumption creates reality</strong>.</p><p>In Genesis 15, God's covenant with Abram is not just a divine contract; it is a step-by-step guide to <strong>inner transformation and manifestation</strong>. Every symbol, from the stars to the sacrifice, mirrors the personal journey of belief, doubt, persistence, and fulfilment. Through Neville’s lens, this chapter becomes a map of how the Promise operates within you.</p><hr /><h3>God’s Assurance: The Shield and Reward (Genesis 15:1)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you safe, and great will be your reward”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The <strong>shield</strong> is your imagination protecting you from doubt and fear; the <strong>reward</strong> is the fulfilment you’ve already imagined. Imagination both defends your inner vision and is itself the promise made real.</p><hr /><h3>Abram’s Doubt: Childlessness (Genesis 15:2–3)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless…?”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> This is the natural protest of reason against the unseen. It represents our early doubts when we first entertain a new possibility—“How can this be?”—yet it sets the stage for the miraculous.</p><hr /><h3>The Stars and the Promise (Genesis 15:4–5)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them. So shall your offspring be.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The <strong>stars</strong> are the limitless potentials of your subconscious. Gazing upward stretches your vision beyond present facts into the infinite abundance imagination offers.</p><hr /><h3>Faith Counted as Righteousness (Genesis 15:6)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness..”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> To <strong>believe</strong> is to assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. This moment—faith held without evidence—is the moral “right alignment” Neville calls “living in the end.”</p><hr /><h3>A Deeper Assurance: Abram’s Question (Genesis 15:7–8)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine?’”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Even after faith, we often seek confirmation. This question marks the shift from mere belief to an inner knowing—a surrender of doubt to certainty.</p><hr /><h3>The Covenant Ritual: Dividing the Animals (Genesis 15:9–10)</h3><blockquote>
<p>Abram brings a heifer, a goat, and a ram—each three years old—plus a turtledove and a young pigeon. He cuts the larger animals in two (birds remain whole) and lays the pieces opposite each other.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The <strong>divided animals</strong> are old emotional patterns and self-images slain to make way for the new. Exposing their “innards” signifies bringing hidden beliefs into conscious surrender.</p><div style="text-align: left;">
<hr />
<p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Dark Sleep and Prophetic Vision (Genesis 15:12–16)</strong></h3><blockquote>As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell on Abram, and a dark, dreadful fear surrounded him. <br /><br />God said to him:<br /> “Your <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">seed</a> will live in a land that isn’t theirs. They will serve those people and suffer for 400 years.<br /> But I will judge that nation, and your seed will come out of it with great riches.<br /> You, Abram, will die peacefully, and be buried at a good old age.<br /> Then, in the fourth generation, they will return to this land—because right now, the wickedness of the Amorites hasn’t yet reached its full measure.”</blockquote><p></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong><br />
The <em>deep sleep</em> represents when your desire is planted into the subconscious. It’s the point where you hand over your wish to the deeper part of you. The <em>darkness and fear</em> that follow are the doubts, resistance, and silence that often come just before change happens.</p>
<p>The “seed” in this passage means the thoughts and assumptions you plant, and is a <a href="/p/genesis-111-seed.html">foundational concept</a> taught in Genesis 1:11. These are your inner descendants—ideas that will grow into real experiences.</p>
<p>The 400 years of slavery symbolise a long period of being trapped by old beliefs—mental habits and emotional patterns that keep you feeling stuck. It’s that time when what you want hasn’t appeared yet, and you feel powerless to change things.</p>
<p>But the story promises that, after the struggle, those inner assumptions will produce real change. “Coming out with great wealth” means finally stepping into your new reality, having persisted in imagining what you wanted, even when nothing seemed to change. The “riches” are the outer results of that inner persistence.</p>
<p>The delay also reminds us that some things don’t happen right away—not because you’ve done anything wrong, but because certain states or patterns (like the sin of the Amorites) have to complete their course first. Transformation always unfolds in order.</p></div><hr /><h3>The Smoking Firepot and Blazing Torch (Genesis 15:17)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.”</em></p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Smoking Firepot:</strong> the mysterious, transformative work of the subconscious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blazing Torch:</strong> conscious awareness holding the vision—“the light of conviction.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passing between the pieces:</strong> the sealing of the covenant, the union of conscious desire and subconscious acceptance to birth reality.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3>The Seal of the Covenant: The Promised Land (Genesis 15:18)</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, ‘To your offspring I give this land… from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.’”</em></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> This final promise—the <strong>land</strong>—is the fertile field of your expanded consciousness. Naming its borders shows that imagination knows no bounds, and the covenant is now fixed within.</p><hr /><h2><strong>Living the Promise: A New State of Being</strong></h2><p>Genesis 15, seen through Neville Goddard’s eyes, is the sacred blueprint of manifestation:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Receive</strong> the inner assurance (shield and reward).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> your doubts (childlessness).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lift</strong> your vision (stars).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Believe</strong> without proof (righteousness).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surrender</strong> deeper doubt (assurance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Release</strong> old states (divided animals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endure</strong> the unseen work (sleep and darkness).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seal</strong> the assumption (firepot and torch).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Claim</strong> the limitless outcome (covenant).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Walk through each step within yourself, and the promise you imagine will one day stand in your hands—just as Abram’s did.</p>
