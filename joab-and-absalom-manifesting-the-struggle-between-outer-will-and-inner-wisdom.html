<h1>Joab and Absalom: Manifesting the Struggle Between Outer Will and Inner Wisdom</h1>
<p><em>A Neville Goddard-Inspired Reflection on Ego, Manifestation, and Inner Transformation</em></p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, the Bible is more than just a historical or religious text; it is a guide to the <strong>mind</strong> and the process of <strong>manifestation</strong>. Through the stories of the Bible, we gain insight into the deeper workings of our <strong>consciousness</strong>, and how we can manifest the life we desire. One such story is that of <strong>Joab</strong> and <strong>Absalom</strong>, where we see a struggle between <strong>outer will</strong> (Joab) and <strong>inner wisdom</strong> (David). In this article, we’ll explore how the death of Absalom—driven by Joab’s decisive action—offers powerful lessons on manifestation and the <strong>inner battle</strong> of the mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Absalom: The Ego and Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>Absalom, the son of King David, symbolises the <strong>ego</strong> in the manifestation process—the false sense of self that is often driven by external validation, pride, and desire for control. Absalom’s <strong>beautiful long hair</strong> and his prideful rebellion represent the <strong>attachment to the physical world</strong> and a <strong>false self-image</strong>. In Neville's terms, Absalom's behaviour is driven by the <strong>desire to control the external world</strong>, seeking to dominate and overthrow the true king—the <strong>imagination</strong> (David).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule… and his head caught hold of the oak… and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth.”</em><br />
— 2 Samuel 18:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>mule</strong> that Absalom rides is symbolic of the <strong>lower state of consciousness</strong>—a force of the mind that does not rise above the material world but remains attached to superficial desires and false self-importance. When Absalom’s <strong>hair becomes caught in the oak tree</strong>, it highlights the <strong>ego’s downfall</strong> when it is attached to <strong>material desires</strong> and <strong>external appearances</strong>, rather than a deeper connection to the imagination and spiritual truth. This can be interpreted as <strong>how attachment to the outer world can prevent you from manifesting your true desires</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Joab: The Outer Will and Force in Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>Joab, the military commander, represents the <strong>outer will</strong>, the part of us that seeks to act decisively, to <strong>manifest through force and action</strong>. While this is a necessary aspect of manifestation, Joab’s lack of alignment with the deeper imagination (David) shows that <strong>acting without inner vision can lead to destruction</strong>.</p>
<p>When Joab sees that Absalom is caught, he takes matters into his own hands—despite David’s plea for mercy—and kills him with <strong>three darts through the heart</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Then said Joab… I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom.”</em><br />
— 2 Samuel 18:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Neville’s philosophy, <strong>Joab’s actions represent the impulsive, forceful approach to manifestation</strong>, where the outer self, driven by <strong>fear</strong> or <strong>duty</strong>, seeks to take control of the situation without aligning with the <strong>inner guidance</strong> of the imagination (David). Joab’s approach is quick and decisive, but without the necessary spiritual alignment. He acts without <strong>trusting the creative power of the imagination</strong>, resorting to brute force instead.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Three Darts: Symbolism of Manifestation and Completion</strong></h3>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s philosophy, the <strong>three darts</strong> are a powerful symbol that provides additional insight into the manifestation process. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Number Three: Completion of a Cycle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>number three</strong> is often associated with <strong>spiritual completion</strong> and represents the completion of a process. In manifestation terms, the three darts could be seen as a final, decisive action that <strong>closes a cycle</strong>—in this case, the <strong>cycle of the ego’s control</strong>. The three darts signify the <strong>final blow to the false self</strong>, the destruction of the ego that has stood in the way of higher consciousness and true manifestation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Heart: The Core of Manifestation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>heart</strong> in Neville’s teachings represents the <strong>core of one’s identity</strong>—the imagination. When Joab strikes the heart, it can be interpreted as the <strong>destruction of the false identity</strong> that has been blocking the manifestation of true desires. Absalom’s death is symbolic of the <strong>end of an ego-driven state of consciousness</strong>, which must occur in order to make room for <strong>the manifestation of new possibilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Three of Swords: Heartbreak and Manifestation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>three darts</strong> also resonate strongly with the <strong>Three of Swords</strong> tarot card. In tarot, the <strong>Three of Swords</strong> is often depicted as a heart pierced by three swords, symbolising <strong>heartbreak, emotional pain</strong>, and the <strong>piercing of the false self</strong>. This card represents a moment of <strong>emotional crisis</strong> or <strong>realisation</strong> that can lead to profound <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of manifestation, the <strong>Three of Swords</strong> can indicate that <strong>emotional release</strong> is necessary for true manifestation to occur. Much like how Absalom’s death represents the <strong>destruction of the ego</strong>, the <strong>three darts</strong> in Joab’s hand could symbolise the <strong>painful but necessary destruction</strong> of the false self, making space for <strong>new desires</strong> to be manifested. The Three of Swords indicates that in order to manifest something new, <strong>you may need to confront and release old emotional wounds</strong>—the heartbreak and pain of the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The three darts, then, <strong>cut through the heart of the ego</strong>, allowing for the <strong>spiritual rebirth</strong> that follows. Manifestation often requires <strong>a release of past attachments</strong> and beliefs, and this piercing of the heart mirrors the painful but <strong>necessary process</strong> of emotional and psychological shedding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>David’s Grief and the True Power of Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>David’s response to Absalom’s death is one of deep grief. David, the embodiment of <strong>the awakened imagination</strong>, represents the <strong>true power behind manifestation</strong>—the <strong>heart-centered</strong> wisdom that shapes the external world through <strong>inner feeling</strong>. David's grief shows that he was <strong>not moved by external circumstances</strong> but by the deeper understanding that <strong>even the ego (Absalom) has a role in the journey of transformation</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants… in that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.”</em><br />
— 2 Samuel 19:6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a manifestation perspective, this grief reflects the <strong>internal conflict</strong> that arises when we recognise the necessary <strong>death of the ego</strong> in the process of personal transformation. The ego, though it must fall, cannot simply be destroyed; it must be <strong>integrated and transcended</strong>, a process that requires <strong>deep emotional work and understanding</strong>.</p>
<p>In Neville’s terms, David’s grief signals the <strong>acknowledgement</strong> of the need to <strong>release the false self</strong> in order to make space for <strong>true creative power</strong>—the kind that comes from the imagination.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>The Final Lesson: Aligning the Outer Will with Inner Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Ultimately, Joab’s actions—though effective in the short term—show us the <strong>limits of the outer will</strong> when not aligned with the inner power of the imagination. His <strong>quick, forceful actions</strong> are necessary in some cases, but when they are not guided by a <strong>higher vision</strong>, they can lead to destructive results.</p>
<p>Joab’s fate serves as a reminder that the <strong>outer will must yield to the inner vision</strong> in the process of manifestation. <strong>Forceful, ego-driven actions</strong> can only bring temporary results. True and lasting manifestation occurs when we <strong>align our outer actions with our inner beliefs</strong>, assumptions, and feelings—guided by the imagination (David), rather than the reactive impulses of the ego (Absalom).</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Manifestation and Transformation: Moving Beyond the Ego</strong></h3>
<p>Joab and Absalom’s story teaches us that while <strong>action</strong> is essential in manifestation, it is the <strong>inner vision and belief</strong> that truly create change. <strong>The ego must fall</strong>, but it does so through a process of <strong>transformation</strong>, not destruction. <strong>Joab’s quick action</strong> highlights the danger of relying solely on the <strong>outer will</strong>. In contrast, <strong>David’s emotional grief</strong> reminds us that true transformation occurs when we release the ego and allow our inner imagination to guide the manifestation process.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Power of the Imagination in Manifestation</strong></h3>
<p>The story of <strong>Joab and Absalom</strong> offers a profound lesson on manifestation: <strong>the outer will (Joab)</strong>, when not aligned with the deeper wisdom of the imagination (David), can lead to destructive results. <strong>The ego (Absalom)</strong> must eventually fall, but it is through <strong>inner awareness and emotional surrender</strong> that true transformation occurs. To manifest the life you desire, you must trust your <strong>imagination</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong>, aligning them with your external actions. When the outer will and inner vision work together, you can <strong>manifest from a place of deep spiritual understanding</strong>, rather than forceful control.</p>
