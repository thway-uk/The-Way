    <h1>What Did Solomon Really Build?</h1>
    <p>In his lectures, Neville Goddard often remarked that it was “obvious” what Solomon built — not referencing a physical structure, but pointing to something far more profound. Solomon, in Neville’s teaching, represents a state of divine wisdom: the understanding that imagination creates reality.</p>
<p>The temple Solomon is said to have built is symbolic. It isn’t made of literal gold or stone, but of disciplined thought, elevated emotion, and an awakened awareness of being. This temple is the human mind, purified and aligned — a sanctuary where the creative power of “I AM” dwells.</p>
<p>When we live from the end, imagining our desires fulfilled, we are laying the foundation and raising the walls of that inner temple. Each moment spent in conscious awareness, in the feeling of already having what we desire, is another stone set in place.</p>
<p>In this light, Solomon’s temple becomes unmistakably clear. <strong>You are it.</strong> Your imagination, rightly directed, is the holy place — the dwelling of God in man.</p>
