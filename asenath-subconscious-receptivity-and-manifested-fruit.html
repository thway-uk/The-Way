<h1>Asenath: Subconscious Receptivity and Manifested Fruit</h1>
<p>In Genesis 41:38-57, Joseph’s symbolic journey, his union with Asenath marks a pivotal moment. As the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (a centre of solar worship), Asenath represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>—receptive, fertile, and capable of manifesting what is consciously assumed. According to Neville Goddard, it is only through this union of conscious assumption and subconscious acceptance that manifestation becomes possible.</p>
<p>Potiphera, whose name relates to “he whom Ra (the sun god) gave,” symbolises the disciplined, illumined <strong>conscious mind</strong>—the priest or guide who directs awareness. His city, On, denotes illumination. This positions Potiphera as a symbol of the <strong>directed conscious thought</strong> that must precede subconscious impression. Asenath, his daughter, thus signifies the fertile subconscious mind <strong>belonging to the awareness that guides it</strong>.</p>
<p>Joseph’s marriage to Asenath is more than narrative detail—it is a mystical marriage of <strong>assumption and receptivity</strong>. In Neville’s terms, Joseph (the imagination and conscious awareness) impresses his desire (his assumption of rulership and fruitfulness) upon Asenath (the subconscious mind). Their children, <strong>Manasseh</strong> (“making to forget”) and <strong>Ephraim</strong> (“fruitfulness”), reflect the process of manifestation itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Manasseh</strong> signifies the <strong>forgetting of former states</strong>—an essential step in Goddard’s teachings. One cannot serve two masters: the new assumption must replace the old. To persist in assuming the wish fulfilled is to relinquish all previous identifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ephraim</strong> signifies <strong>the result of successful assumption</strong>: outward fruitfulness, or the visible evidence of the inner assumption having taken root.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire episode encapsulates a cycle: the conscious assumption of the desired state (Joseph), its acceptance by the subconscious (Asenath), and the eventual outpicturing in form (Manasseh and Ephraim). It affirms Neville’s core principle: what we unite ourselves to in imagination—when felt to be true and impressed upon the subconscious—<strong>must be born into our world</strong>.</p>
