<title>Esau and Jacob: Reconciliation</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Esau and Jacob: Reconciliation</h1>
<p>When we turn to Genesis 33, we encounter the long-awaited meeting between Jacob and Esau — two brothers divided by a stolen blessing, now reunited after years apart.</p><p>On the surface, it is a story of family reconciliation. But through Neville Goddard’s teachings, it reveals a psychological truth: the relationship between two <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">aspects</a> within us.</p><hr /><h3>Jacob and Esau: Two '<a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">Men</a>'</h3><p>In Neville’s symbolic reading:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong> represents the developing imaginative <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">aspect of the self</a> — the inner man who dares to assume new states of being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Esau</strong> symbolises the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">psychological self</a> that lives by sense evidence — the part of us convinced by outer facts and appearances.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>“Esau is the man of the field — tied to appearances. Jacob is the contemplative, the dreamer, the creator.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Though Esau appears stronger and elder (sense evidence seems to come first), imagination is truly supreme. The so-called “facts” of life have no power except the power we give them through our attention and belief.</p><hr /><h3>The Fear of Sense Evidence</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed...”</em><br />
— Genesis 32:7</p>
</blockquote><p>As Jacob approaches Esau, he fears rejection and retaliation.</p><p>This mirrors our inner struggle: after assuming a new state — health, abundance, love — we fear that our sense-based self will overpower or sabotage our new conviction.</p><p>Jacob’s fear represents the common anxiety that the evidence of the senses will dominate the imaginative claim. Yet, despite this, Jacob presses forward — an act of inner persistence we are all called to embody.</p><hr /><h3>The Embrace: Inner Harmony</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.”</em><br />
— Genesis 33:4</p>
</blockquote><p>Esau, once perceived as an enemy, runs to Jacob and embraces him.</p><p>This is the moment when the sense-based self yields to the imaginative self. When imagination is faithfully sustained, even the psychological aspect that once resisted comes into harmony with the new assumption.</p><p>Jacob offers Esau gifts — a symbolic act of pouring gratitude into the newly aligned part of self.</p><hr /><h3>"I Have Seen the Face of God"</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>“I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.”</em><br />
— Genesis 33:10</p>
</blockquote><p>When our sense-based self finally reflects the inner conviction, it feels as though we are seeing the face of God.</p><p>In Neville’s teaching, <a href="/2025/06/elohim-name-of-god-and-power-of.html">God is our own wonderful human imagination</a>. The outer conditions we once feared become friendly reflections, revealing the divine creative power within.</p><hr /><h3>The Parallel with Saul and David</h3><p>This inner drama is echoed in the story of <strong>Saul and David</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Saul</strong> represents the old psychological state, built on past assumptions and sense-based rulership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> symbolises the new inner conviction — the anointed imaginative claim destined to reign.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At first, Saul dominates and tries to destroy David, just as our old beliefs resist the new inner assumption. Yet through unwavering persistence, David ultimately replaces Saul completely.</p><p>While Jacob and Esau illustrate reconciliation and harmony within, Saul and David represent conflict and full succession — the new imaginative self taking full dominion.</p><hr /><h3>The Echo in Cain and Abel</h3><p>The story of <strong><a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">Cain and Abel</a></strong> also reveals this same psychological pattern.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abel</strong> represents the imaginative, feeling <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self</a> that offers a "living" sacrifice — the state of living in the end and feeling the wish fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cain</strong> symbolises the <a href="/2025/05/in-our-image-divine-pattern-of-division.html">self</a> that depends on outer effort and sense evidence — striving from the ground, tied to facts and appearances.</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em>“By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.”</em> — Hebrews 11:4</p>
</blockquote><p>Cain becomes jealous when Abel’s offering (imaginative faith) is <a href="/2025/05/sin-at-door-how-bible-defines-sin.html">favoured</a>. Symbolically, this describes how our reliance on facts (Cain) suppresses or "kills" the inner feeling of conviction (Abel).</p><p>Just as with Esau and Saul, Cain appears dominant at first, but the pattern always points to the triumph of the imaginative self. In each story, the message is clear: <strong>imagination is the true creative power, destined to rise above sense-bound thinking</strong>.</p><hr /><blockquote><p><em><br />“And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.”</em><br />
— Genesis 33:3</p>
</blockquote><p>Jacob’s seven bows symbolise humility and respect for the psychological process — honouring that every part of the self, even the sense-based part, is worthy of attention and understanding.</p><hr /><h3>Final Reflection</h3><p>The reconciliation of Jacob and Esau is not merely a touching story of family forgiveness; it is a profound psychological truth:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>When imagination is faithfully maintained, every part of the self — even those long ruled by sense evidence — will eventually come into loving harmony and reflect the new inner state with joy.</em></p></blockquote>
