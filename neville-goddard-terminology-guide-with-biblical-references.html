<h1>Neville Goddard Terminology Guide with Biblical References</h1>
<p>Explore the foundational terms of Neville Goddard’s teachings, each illuminated with relevant Bible passages. These terms reframe traditional scripture as practical instruction for inner transformation and the manifestation of desires.</p><hr /><h3><strong>1. I AM</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Your fundamental awareness of being; God within you.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Exodus 3:14</em> — “I AM THAT I AM.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>John 8:58</em> — “Before Abraham was, I am.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> This is the name of God and your own essential identity. Any state you attach to “I AM” becomes manifest.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>2. Imagination</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The creative power of God in man.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Genesis 1:27</em> — “God created man in his own image.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ephesians 3:20</em> — “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly... according to the power that worketh in us.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Imagination is not fantasy — it is the spiritual act that precedes manifestation. God creates through imagination, and so do you.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>3. Assumption</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Accepting a desired state as already true.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Mark 11:24</em> — “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled impresses it on the subconscious and brings it to life.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>4. Feeling</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The emotional acceptance of a state.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Romans 4:17</em> — “... calleth those things which be not as though they were.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Proverbs 23:7</em> — “As he thinketh in his heart, so is he.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Feeling is the secret — thought without feeling is powerless.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>5. State / State of Consciousness</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> A psychological identity or condition. You move from one state to another.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ecclesiastes 3:1</em> — “To everything there is a season...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 15:17</em> — “And when he came to himself...”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> You’re not stuck — any Biblical character can be assumed as a state now.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>6. Revision</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Changing past events in imagination to heal or rewrite outcomes.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Joel 2:25</em> — “And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Genesis 50:20</em> — “Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> By revising a scene, you revise its emotional imprint and create a new chain of events.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>7. Subconscious</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The creative womb of reality; receives impressions from the conscious mind.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 1:38</em> — “Be it unto me according to thy word.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Whatever the conscious mind persistently feels as true is impressed upon the subconscious, which brings it to pass.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>8. Faith</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Loyalty to the unseen reality.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Hebrews 11:1</em> — “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Faith is imaginative. To persist in the unseen assumption is true faith.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>9. Bridge of Incidents</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The natural but often unpredictable series of events leading to the fulfilment of a desire.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Romans 8:28</em> — “All things work together for good...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Psalm 37:23</em> — “The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> You don’t control the bridge — assume the end, and the means will unfold.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>10. Living in the End</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Dwelling mentally in the state of the wish fulfilled.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>John 11:41</em> — “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Imagine from the end, not toward it. Live <em>as if it were true.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>11. Death</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Letting go of one state or identity; symbolic, not physical.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>1 Corinthians 15:31</em> — “I die daily.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>John 12:24</em> — “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone...”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Death is simply moving from one state of consciousness to another.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>12. Crucifixion</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fixing an assumption in imagination. Also refers to psychological pain involved in state transitions.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Galatians 2:20</em> — “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live...”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Crucifixion is not tragedy but transition — the moment of full identification with your new state.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>13. Resurrection</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The rising of a state into manifestation.<br />
<strong>Bible Reference:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>John 11:25</em> — “I am the resurrection, and the life.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> When your assumption becomes reality, the state has resurrected in your world.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>14. Inner Speech</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The mental dialogue you continually hold with yourself.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Isaiah 55:11</em> — “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth...”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Luke 7:7</em> — “... but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Your inner speech is your command to life. Watch what you’re saying inside — it’s creating.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>15. Prayer</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The controlled use of imagination to accept a new state.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Matthew 6:6</em> — “Enter into thy closet... and pray to thy Father which is in secret.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Matthew 21:22</em> — “All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> Prayer is the art of assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled — not asking, but claiming.</p>
</li>
</ul><hr /><h3><strong>16. Law and Promise</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Law:</strong> The impersonal, mechanical process of manifestation (assumption, feeling, persistence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promise:</strong> The mystical, individual fulfilment of union with God — Neville’s personal experiences.<br />
<strong>Bible References:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Galatians 3:18</em> — “God gave it to Abraham by promise.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Romans 2:11</em> — “For there is no respect of persons with God.”<br />
<strong>Neville’s View:</strong> The Law works for all who apply it. The Promise is the spiritual destiny of every soul.</p></li></ul>
