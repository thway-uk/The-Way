<h1>Women at the Resurrection</h1>
<p><strong></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles."</strong></p><p>
— <em>Luke 24:10, KJV</em></p></blockquote><p><em></em></p>
<p>In Neville Goddard’s teachings, this verse reveals the role of the subconscious mind in creation. The <a href="/2025/05/bone-of-my-bones-neville-goddard-on.html">women</a> who first witness the resurrection are symbols of the subconscious—emotional, nurturing, and receptive to the desires planted by the conscious mind.</p>
<h3>Mary Magdalene: The Subconscious Devotion</h3>
<p>Mary Magdalene, representing the subconscious mind, is the first to encounter the risen Christ. This signifies that the subconscious is the first to witness the manifestation of a new state of being. Her devotion reflects the unwavering feeling of imagination, the nurturing force that brings desires to life.</p>
<h3>Joanna: Faith in Creation</h3>
<p>Joanna, whose name means "God is gracious," embodies faith—the essential element for bringing forth new realities. Faith is the unwavering belief in the unseen, the trust that the desires of the heart will be made manifest.</p>
<h3>Mary, Mother of James: The Foundation of Creation</h3>
<p>Mary, the mother of James, symbolises the foundational nurturing of the subconscious. She represents the deep emotional foundation that supports and brings life to new desires, ensuring that they grow and manifest into the visible world.</p>
<h3>Proclaiming the Resurrection: The New State of Being</h3>
<p>When the women tell the apostles, they symbolise how the subconscious communicates the new state of being to the conscious mind. The subconscious mind nurtures, sustains, and then presents the new reality to consciousness, completing the process of resurrection.</p>
<p>In this passage, the women—Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary—embody the subconscious mind’s essential role in creation. Through devotion, faith, and a strong foundation, the subconscious nurtures and births new realities, making the resurrection not just an event, but the birth of a new state of being within us.</p>
