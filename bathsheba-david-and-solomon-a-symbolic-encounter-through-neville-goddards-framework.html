    <h1>Bathsheba, David and Solomon: A Symbolic Encounter Through Neville Goddard’s Framework</h1>
    <p>The story of <strong>Bathsheba</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Solomon</strong> in the Bible is one of power, desire, and divine manifestation. Through the lens of Neville Goddard’s teachings on <strong>imagination</strong> and <strong>manifestation</strong>, this narrative reveals profound symbolic lessons about how desires are conceived, nurtured, and brought into the physical world. By examining the <strong>Hebrew meanings</strong> of the names of <strong>Bathsheba</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Solomon</strong>, we gain deeper insight into their symbolic roles within the framework of manifestation.</p><h3>Bathsheba: The Subconscious Mind, Nurturing Desires</h3><p>The name <strong>Bathsheba</strong> (בַּת-שֶׁבַע) in Hebrew means "daughter of the oath" or "daughter of seven." The number <strong>seven</strong> in biblical numerology signifies <strong>completion</strong>, <strong>perfection</strong>, and <strong>spiritual fulfilment</strong>. In Neville Goddard's teachings, Bathsheba represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, the fertile ground where desires are planted and nurtured into physical manifestation. The <strong>oath</strong> in her name signifies the <strong>faithful promise</strong> of the subconscious mind to bring forth whatever is impressed upon it.</p><p>In <strong>2 Samuel 11:2-4</strong>, the Bible recounts how <strong>David</strong> saw <strong>Bathsheba</strong> from his rooftop and was immediately struck by her beauty. Despite the circumstances, he desired her, and she became pregnant. This story is symbolic of how <strong>the conscious mind (David)</strong> focuses on a desire, and <strong>the subconscious mind (Bathsheba)</strong>, once the desire is planted, nurtures it into reality.</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"And it came to pass in an evening tide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon."</em> (2 Samuel 11:2)</p>
</blockquote><p>Bathsheba’s pregnancy in this narrative speaks to the <strong>nurturing power</strong> of the subconscious mind. Once the seed (desire) is planted, the subconscious (Bathsheba) begins to <strong>nurture</strong> it, eventually giving birth to the manifestation (Solomon).</p><h3>David: The Conscious Mind, Focused on the Desired Goal</h3><p>The name <strong>David</strong> (דָּוִד) in Hebrew means "beloved" or "friend." As the <strong>conscious mind</strong>, David represents the <strong>active force</strong> that desires a goal and <strong>focuses on it</strong> with emotional attachment. The key to manifestation is to focus on a desire with <strong>intensity</strong> and <strong>emotion</strong>, as David does with Bathsheba.</p><p>David’s love for Bathsheba is not just physical but emotional, as he pursues her despite the complications. This can be seen as an analogy to how we must persist in our desire, <strong>nurturing it through focus and emotion</strong>, regardless of the challenges. In Neville Goddard's teachings, it’s not enough to simply think about a desire; we must feel it deeply, <strong>as David felt his love for Bathsheba</strong>.</p><p>The Bible provides additional verses that show David’s emotional connection to Bathsheba:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.”</em> (2 Samuel 11:4)</p>
</blockquote><p>This moment of union between David and Bathsheba represents the <strong>union between the conscious mind (David)</strong> and the <strong>subconscious mind (Bathsheba)</strong>. The desire (David’s love for Bathsheba) is now planted into the subconscious (Bathsheba), and the process of manifestation begins.</p><h3>Solomon: The Manifestation, The Fruit of the Desire</h3><p>The name <strong>Solomon</strong> (שׁלמה, Shlomo) in Hebrew means "peace" or "peaceful." Solomon represents the <strong>manifestation</strong> of the desire, the <strong>fruit</strong> of the interaction between the conscious and subconscious minds. When David's desire was fully impressed upon Bathsheba, she conceived Solomon, symbolising how a <strong>clear, focused desire</strong> (David) nurtured by the subconscious mind (Bathsheba) results in the peaceful manifestation of that desire (Solomon).</p><p>In <strong>2 Samuel 12:24-25</strong>, after the death of their first child, Bathsheba gave birth to <strong>Solomon</strong>:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the Lord loved him.”</em> (2 Samuel 12:24)</p>
</blockquote><p>Solomon's birth is symbolic of <strong>the peaceful manifestation</strong> that comes when the conscious mind (David) and the subconscious mind (Bathsheba) work together in harmony. In Neville’s teachings, this is how manifestation works: the conscious mind plants the desire, the subconscious mind nurtures it, and the <strong>manifested result</strong> is the peaceful realisation of the goal (Solomon).</p><h3>The Encounter: Imagination, Subconscious Mind, and Manifestation</h3><p>The story of <strong>Bathsheba</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Solomon</strong> is not just a tale of love and consequence but a powerful metaphor for the process of <strong>manifestation</strong>. In Neville Goddard’s framework, Bathsheba represents the <strong>subconscious mind</strong>, the fertile soil where desires are planted and nurtured. David, as the <strong>conscious mind</strong>, focuses on a goal with intense emotional attachment. Solomon represents the <strong>final manifestation</strong>, the peaceful result of the alignment between the conscious and subconscious minds.</p><p>The union of <strong>David and Bathsheba</strong> speaks to the alignment between the conscious and subconscious minds. Their connection—despite the circumstances—is a reminder that when <strong>imagination</strong> (David) and the <strong>subconscious</strong> (Bathsheba) are in harmony, the result is the peaceful manifestation of the desire (Solomon).</p><h3>A Spiritual Lesson in Manifestation</h3><p>The biblical story of Bathsheba, David, and Solomon is rich in symbolic lessons for <strong>manifestation</strong>. By focusing on the <strong>Hebrew meanings</strong> of their names, we see how each character plays a role in bringing a desire into the physical world:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>David</strong> (the conscious mind) <strong>desires</strong> and focuses on the goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bathsheba</strong> (the subconscious mind) <strong>nurtures</strong> the desire, bringing it to fruition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solomon</strong> (the manifestation) is the <strong>peaceful manifestation</strong> of the goal.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In Neville Goddard's teachings, manifestation is the result of the <strong>union</strong> of these two forces—imagination and subconscious—working in harmony. David’s love for Bathsheba represents the desire and focus required, and Solomon’s birth is the <strong>peaceful manifestation</strong> of that desire.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The encounter between <strong>Bathsheba</strong>, <strong>David</strong>, and <strong>Solomon</strong> is a profound allegory of the <strong>manifestation process</strong>. By aligning the <strong>conscious mind</strong> (David) with the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> (Bathsheba), and nurturing the desire through <strong>focused imagination</strong>, the result is the peaceful manifestation of the desire (Solomon).</p><p>In Neville Goddard’s framework, we learn that the key to manifestation lies in <strong>impressing</strong> the subconscious mind with strong, focused desire and <strong>faith</strong>. The peaceful realisation of our goals, like Solomon, is the inevitable outcome when the conscious and subconscious minds are united in purpose and intention.</p><p><br /></p>
